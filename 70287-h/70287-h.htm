<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>This is not a preface but merely a few words to state that in
writing these pages I have in no way tried to criticize the French
administration or to discuss the Arab from any point of view but
that of a spectator.</p>

<p>I have no political feelings, few ambitions beyond living simply
and far away from the world, and if this work exists at all, it is
because I have wished that people should know Algeria as it really
is.</p>

<p>Once upon a time I had great ideas about worldly position and
the sound of long titles; I believed that greatness was to be
achieved in the capitals of Europe or on the battle-fields, but I
know now that this is not so. Worldly positions and great titles
are the weary outcome of much money laboriously reaped, and the
heroes of battle-fields pass unnoticed in the street.</p>

<p>Southern Algeria, with all its charm, with all its capricious
moods, has, like some lovely woman, taken me in its arms and I am
doubtful if it will ever let me go.</p>

<p>Let this book therefore be read in the spirit in which it has
been written by one who, having seen life in many parts of the
globe, has found peace and solution to all worldly difficulties
among the rustling palm-trees and broad expanses of the Sahara.</p>

<p>I must here take the opportunity of thanking certain kind
friends who have helped me in my work, notably:</p>

<p>Monsieur Jean Causeret, Secrétaire Général du Gouvernement
Général, who has supplied me with maps, Dr. Alfred S. Gubb, the
well-known English physician in Algiers, the Rev. Lucius Fry,
British Chaplain in Algiers, and Mrs. Clare Sheridan, who have all
lent me photos appearing in these pages. My thanks are also due to
Mrs. Welthin Winlo, whose untiring secretarial work has helped me
to prepare this work, to Miss Una Thomas who has helped me with the
proofs, and to Mr. Julian Sampson, who has not only supplied me
with photographs, but who has also brought his expert knowledge to
bear in the selecting of suitable illustrations.</p>

<p class="xlarge center space-above letter-spaced pb">ALGERIA FROM
WITHIN</p>

<h2 class="nopb"><a id="c01"></a>CHAPTER I<br>
<span class="sc2">THE OBJECT OF THE BOOK</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">A writer</span> who sets out to study a foreign
country such as Algeria is faced with two difficulties: the first,
the natural suspicion of the Mohammedan population; the second, the
little information obtainable from the French inhabitants of the
country.</p>

<p>It has been possible to overcome the first difficulty by making
the Arab realize that there was no intention to interfere with his
interior life or to obtain information in order to denounce family
secrets. The second difficulty has remained. This is due to two
factors. The first is the ignorance of the majority of Frenchmen,
whether they be business men or colonists, of the customs and
peculiarities of any area not neighboring that in which they
actually dwell; the second is the French administrator’s apparent
lack of information on anything beyond that which is not already to
be found in the official handbooks.</p>

<p>When occasionally one meets some one with a deeper knowledge of
the matters which should interest him, it is hard, as a foreigner,
to obtain any valuable data. The Frenchman finds it difficult to
realize that any one can wish to peer into the inner workings of a
foreign country without some ulterior motive. If it is not
deliberate spying for a jealous government, it is to steal a march
on some business enterprise!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
</p>

<p>Comprehensive books on Algeria of to-day are few, and usually
contradict one another, according to the point of view of the
writers.</p>

<p>The only solution, therefore, to the problem of writing this
book has been for the author to settle in the country, living the
life of its people, and gleaning what information was possible as a
business man in the city of Algiers, as a sheep-breeder on the
Sahara, and as a traveler across the great plains and mountains of
this sunny land.</p>

<p>The title of the book has perhaps a pretentious sound,
suggesting that Algeria is some unexplored country into which the
writer has penetrated, bringing back with him revelations of
unknown mysteries never yet set before the public. But though this
is not the case, it is hoped that the reader, be he a tourist or
scholar, will find in these pages information which is new and
interesting—<i>Algeria from Within</i> in opposition to the Algeria
from “<i>without</i>” as set down by travelers who have passed a
few winter months in the country and who, returning home, have
compiled an inaccurate volume based on first impressions and on
legends served up very hot by the hard-worked guides.</p>

<p>These legends will have to be dispelled at the cost of
disillusioning veteran visitors who pass winter after winter in the
overheated hotels of Mustapha Supérieur. But, against this, the
book will endeavor to explain shortly and accurately what this
French colony really is, what its people are doing and thinking,
wherein lies its future.</p>

<p>There have been no aspirations to make of it a comprehensive
guide-book or survey of the country’s long history, neither has any
attempt been made to criticize the French rule, or to compare it
with the administration of other colonies. True facts
have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> been set down as
seen by one who has lived many years in the country, constantly
studying all about him without confining himself to one area nor to
one class of people. Living not only in the big cities, but also in
the cultivated plains, in the desolation of the desert, and mixing
with the French administrators, with business men, with the
colonists, and visiting the Arabs in such intimacy that it is
possible to tell of their daily life as it is really lived.</p>

<p>It is more a pen-picture of Algeria and the Sahara as it is
to-day, drawn in the desire that the reader— be he traveler in all
the senses of the word or one who journeys by his fireside on long
winter evenings— will close the volume with a feeling that he has
peeped for a moment into the intimate life of a country which, with
all its youthful future, has a background of history more varied
perhaps than any other country in the world. . . .</p>

<p>To the average tourist who leaves the misty London station in
search of warmth and sunshine, the country he is about to visit is
probably a somewhat uncertain vision of blue skies, palm-trees, and
stately Arabs.</p>

<p>The inspired artists of the P. L. M. railway posters have
dazzled his eyes with enchanting prospects of palm-green shores and
rolling expanses of sand, golden in a perpetual sunset, while the
scaleless maps of tourist agencies have graven in his mind the
names Algiers, Biskra, Fez and Tunis, leaving him with a vague
impression that all these places are in the same country and within
easy reach of one another.</p>

<p>His mind is rather in the same state as that of the old lady who
asks the officer going to India not to forget to look up her nephew
who is stationed in Burmah. He has probably not realized that
Algeria<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> differs
greatly from Tunisia and Morocco in people and in government, and
that it has no connections whatever with either of these two
countries which form its eastern and western frontiers.</p>

<p>Even winter residents and regular visitors to Algeria know the
country very superficially, and though some have ventured along the
beaten tracks as far as the oases of Touggourt and Ghardaia, there
are few who have left the main roads and mixed in the private life
of the country. And what blame to them? There are few railways, and
the motor-transport time-tables are lacking. The guide-books do not
dwell upon places off the classical tours, the information at the
tourist agencies goes no further, and even if the adventurous
traveler pushes into the unfrequented regions, he will find no one
to guide him, and unless he knows Arabic he will often be unable to
make himself understood. Even when the acquaintance of an Arab
chief has been made it takes many months to break through his
exterior façade and to obtain a glimpse of his thoughts or his
private life.</p>

<p>This book, therefore—which should be read in conjunction with a
guide-book—will endeavor to lift a veil on matters which are of the
deepest interest to all those who want to learn something about a
land which must appeal to the most blasé traveler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c02"></a>CHAPTER II<br>
<span class="sc2">A LITTLE GEOGRAPHY</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Algeria</span> is situated some fifteen hundred
miles due south of London, and is accessible via Paris and
Marseilles in fifty hours, or by sea from Southhampton in four
days. The country is bounded on the north by the Mediterranean, on
the east by Tunisia, and on the west by Morocco. Its southern
boundary is difficult to define, as, though in reality Algeria
extends right across the desert to Senegal, Algeria proper does not
go farther than the northerly tracts of the Sahara.</p>

<p>Moreover, although considered as a French colony, the country is
divided into three departments or counties, having the same status
as if in France. From east to west they are Constantine, Alger,
Oranie, and there is a further area lying south of these
departments known as the Territoires du Sud.</p>

<p>The actual area of the country, again, is uncertain, owing to
the great tracts of desert, but, roughly speaking, it can be said
that the cultivated and inhabited areas comprising the three
departments cover an area of 222,000 square miles—a little smaller
than France. Including the Sahara, the country must be reckoned at
1,071,000 square miles.</p>

<p>By natural configuration the land is divided into four distinct
belts: the low hills which border the coast protecting the rich
cereal and vine lands from the sea winds; the Little Atlas or
Mountains of the Tell, which include the lofty peaks of the
Kabyle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> country; the
Sersou, forming a kind of broad valley between the hills and the
Hauts Plateaux which, as the name implies, is a high tableland,
some two thousand feet above sea-level and rolling down to the
desert three hundred miles south of the coast; and the Sahara,
stretching away to Senegal.</p>

<p>The desert can, again, be divided into different areas. Its
northern belts, covered with a kind of scrub, thyme and mint,
afford ample nourishment to the flocks of sheep and goats all the
winter, while camels can always find plenty to eat there. Beyond
this pasture-land, is the rock and the sand desert, the former
greatly exceeding the latter in area. It is a desolate and
cruel-looking country, except where the oases spring up and form
centers unexpectedly rich not only in palms, but also in all kinds
of fruit-trees.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, therefore, Algeria is a hilly country, and
the Sahara is far from flat; the whole land is very fertile
wherever there is water, but subject to great extremes of climate.
What surprises the traveler most, after a tour through any of the
three departments and down to the desert, is first of all the
astonishing variety of scenery through which he passes, and second,
the amount of natural products of the land.</p>

<p>The roads along the coast give a wonderful impression of marine
scenery—deep red cliffs and a sapphire sea.</p>

<p>To the east of Algiers, forests of cork-trees border the road,
olive-yards cover the slopes of the hills, while every now and then
one sees extensive tobacco plantations.</p>

<p>Turning inland, the traveler will pass through more forests,
then, climbing into the Kabyle Mountains, he will come to the
fig-trees clothing the steep hills, till up and up he climbs to a
level of some five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
thousand feet above the sea. Towering mountains are about him, deep
in snow for four months of the year and quite unexpectedly cold in
this sunny Africa.</p>

<p>Following the coast in a westerly direction, he will traverse
miles of all kinds of vegetables, grown by the local farmers for
export to France and England. The new potatoes, the salads and
tomatoes, associated with exorbitant prices in Paris in winter,
will be seen ripening under this southern sun.</p>

<p>If the journey is continued farther west into the confines of
Oranie a few cotton plantations will be seen, then the vast plains
of cereals—the ancient granary of the Roman Empire—which now that
the old system of irrigation has disappeared are sadly dependent on
the rainfall.</p>

<p>Turning inland from Algiers, the hills bordering the coast are
left behind and the vine-clad plain of the Mitidja is entered. For
two hours the car will pass swiftly through vineyard after
vineyard, while here and there rich orange-groves will relieve the
monotony of the interminable lines of vines. The wine produced in
this area is much richer and of higher alcoholic degree than that
of France, and in a normal year not only suffices for all the wants
of the country, but is exported in large quantities to the mother
country, where it is used to cut the Burgundies and Bordeaux, and
in some cases to be sold as French <i>vin ordinaire</i>.</p>

<p>Moving still in a southerly direction, the country becomes
mountainous as the Atlas range is entered. The slopes are covered
with mountain-oak, pine-trees, and now and then cork, but, though
this is supposed to be one of the forest-lands of Algeria, the
traveler needs to be notified of the fact. There is, however, one
very fine cedar forest above Teniet el Haad, but it is rarely
visited as it is off the beaten track. The hills are full of
tailless monkeys—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Barbary ape—which come down to the roadside, where there are
inhabitants and prospects of food.</p>

<p>Beyond the Atlas range, here known as the Tell, where cattle and
horses are raised, the country slopes down on to the wide pastures
of the Sersou; it is now very flat and desertic in appearance. Soon
the tufts of alfa grass are noticed growing in tall bunches right
away as far as the eye can reach, and farther, for hundreds of
miles to east and west extend these tracts of paper-making grass.
Many of the concessions are owned by British concerns, which,
having picked the raw material, despatch it to the Lancashire
papermills to be manufactured.</p>

<p>Leaving the alfa, the country again becomes mountainous and
wooded as the Hauts Plateaux are reached. The trees do not,
however, last long, as soon the downward grade is begun, with the
rich pasture-lands which run right away into the desert. This is
the land of sheep-breeding, and as one travels along one sees
countless flocks of sheep and goats.</p>

<p>The beginning of the Sahara is clearly defined by the sudden
disappearance of the low, barren hills which have marked the
descent from the Hauts Plateaux. The reappearance, too, of the
palm-tree, which has not been seen since Algiers, reminds one that
one is in the land of the oases, while away, away, stretches the
desert, till its grayness merges in the sky like some eternally
calm sea.</p>

<p>The pasture continues for a few hundred miles and then gradually
disappears, giving place to stones and rocks, desolate and
merciless, until in turn these give way to rolling sands, and again
to barren wastes of pebbles, broken only by the welcome water-point
or the green oasis offering relief to weary wanderers.</p>

<p>In a few words, this is the scenery of Algeria, and after a
week’s journeying the traveler is really<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_21">[21]</span> amazed at the thought that all he has seen is
in one country, so varied has been his impression.</p>

</div>

<p>Algiers, with its sub-tropical gardens and modern improvements,
the sea coast, the broad plains of cereals, the rich vineyards, the
orange-groves and olive-yards, the forests of cork and pine, the
wild mountains, the silent expanses of alfa, the nomads on the
pastures, and the limitless Sahara!</p>

<p>Further, if one remains a year in the country one will realize
the difficulties with which the settler is faced owing to the
extremes of climate. Generally speaking, it rains too much north of
the Sersou during the months of November, December, and January. It
never rains too much in the south. The summer and spring are too
dry, and, whereas in the winter there is frost as far south as the
edge of the Sahara, the summer heat is everywhere excessive. The
heat is especially unpleasant in Algiers and along the coast on
account of the damp; at midday in the plains it is intolerable, and
when the sirocco blows from the desert, life is wretched all over
the smitten area.</p>

<p>Irrigation is in its childhood; artificial pasturage is unknown,
with the result that a good or a bad year depends entirely on the
caprices of the weather. Generally speaking, one can say that in a
period of seven years there are two very good years, four average
years, and one bad year.</p>

<p>When the year is good it is beyond all imagination, and it is,
in fact, said that the two very good years should pay for any
losses in the remaining five!</p>

<p>A land of light and shade, of everlasting contrasts, a land
which, like a lovely woman, charms one by its unexpectedness, by
its tenderness and sudden harshness, by all its capricious moods. A
land of the future, but a land also of the past—and this, perforce,
brings us to the next chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c03"></a>CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="sc2">A LITTLE HISTORY</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> original inhabitants of Algeria were
Berbers. The present native inhabitant of Algeria is the Berber,
and yet ask any one who the natives are and they will reply
“Arabs”; some of the more intelligent will perhaps say “Arabs with
a sprinkling of Berbers.”</p>

<p>But this is wrong. When history first threw light on North
Africa the Berbers were there, and they have not yet departed. It
is true that many invasions and upheavals have passed through
Algeria during the past three thousand years, but, though they have
left their trace, it is only the Arabs who have really left their
mark on the original inhabitants.</p>

<p>The first important landmark in the history of North Africa is
the foundation of Carthage about the year 840 <span class="sc2">B.
C.</span> The Phœnicians had already settled on the Tunisian coast
for some three hundred years previous to this, but their importance
dates from the foundation of their great city, which was to have
such an influence on the history of the civilized world for six
hundred years.</p>

<p>Since this book, however, is not a history of the country, it
will be sufficient to mention the outstanding historical features
during those long years during which war and invasion centered
round the North African shores. The Carthaginian domination
flourished in all its splendor until the year 264 <span class=
"sc2">B. C.</span> Up to this period those hardy merchant mariners
were masters of the whole of the Mediterranean; they
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> explored the
Atlantic coast as far as Sierra Leone; one expedition had sailed
right round the African continent; and they had made it clear to
Rome that they would brook no interference. Carthaginian naval
power was supreme, and she counted on that alone to ensure her
sovereignty of the Mediterranean. In the latter half, therefore, of
that century she had defied Rome, and in a few years came into
armed conflict with the future masters of the world.</p>

<p>This armed conflict, which was to last for over eighty years,
and which was to produce those names famous to every public
schoolboy who does not despise classical education—Hanno, Hamilcar,
Hannibal, Hasdrubal, Scipio, Fabius Maximus—ended in 146
<span class="sc2">B. C.</span> with the destruction of Carthage and
the foundation of a Roman province consisting of modern Tunisia and
part of Tripoli. One hundred years later Numidia, Algeria of
to-day, was annexed, and for the next four hundred years the march
of empire continued. At first the Romans were not a little
embarrassed with their new acquisitions, all the more so on account
of the hostile attitude of the Numidian kings at Cirta (modern
Constantine). Strifes and minor wars continued for some time. Rome
aided first one side and then another, but, finally realizing the
futility of her rôle, a strong expedition was despatched and
finally succeeded in defeating the Numidian king Jugurtha. It was
not, however, until the year 46 <span class="sc2">B. C.</span> that
Cæsar finally routed Juba on the Tunisian coast and in that defeat
destroyed the kingdom of Numidia.</p>

<p>The son of Juba, who had been taken to Italy and educated as a
Roman, was married to the daughter of Antony and Cleopatra, and was
eventually placed on the throne of Numidia, where he ruled in
splendor until the year 19 <span class="sc2">B. C.</span> During
his reign the empire had spread and extended over North Africa from
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> Tunisian coast to
the Atlantic, and its military posts guarded the entries of the
Sahara. The traces of once-glorious Rome remain in various states
of ruin to this day, and will be dealt with in further chapters. It
would take too long to enter into details of the administration of
the country under the Imperial eagle and of the birth and growth of
Christianity in North Africa. The Roman Empire had spread, and it
was not until the beginning of its fall that the rule in North
Africa tottered.</p>

<p>Ever since the beginning of the fifth century <span class=
"sc2">A. D.</span> Roman possessions in Europe were being flooded
by the advance of the Vandals. In 428 the terrible Genesric crossed
to Africa from Spain, with an army of ninety thousand men, and
landed at Ceuta. Like all new invaders, he was welcomed as a
savior, and his success was instantaneous. He swept the Roman
armies before him, he built a fleet and became the terror of the
Mediterranean, and in 455 took Rome.</p>

<p>How far these conquests would have continued it is difficult to
say had not Genesric died. With his death his followers, who had
drifted into an easy-going state, no longer held together, but
became the prey of jealous strifes among chiefs. Their fall was
rapid. The Roman Government, now transferred to Constantinople, was
awaiting the opportunity to avenge its defeat. A little more than a
hundred years after the landing of the Vandals in Africa,
Belisarius sailed from Constantinople with six hundred ships, and
three months later landed in Tripoli.</p>

<p>The Byzantine invasion had begun, and in three months Belisarius
was able to announce to the Emperor Justinian that North Africa was
again part of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>But the Byzantine rule did not last long. The country was rent
by wars and revolts; the people<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_25">[25]</span> were worn out with changes of government;
and, though there remain great forts and mightily walled cities as
a record of this rule, they are evidence in themselves of the
turbulent times which shook the country. When, therefore, the first
Arab invasion poured in, there was nothing to quell it, and for one
last time Imperial Rome struggled for a moment, staggered and
fell.</p>

<p>The first Arab invasion of the seventh century was more a series
of raids than anything else. Mohammed had appeared and died, but
his teaching had remained, and had inspired those bands of wild
nomads to organize themselves. Persia, Syria, Egypt had fallen
before the advance, and soon they began moving farther west. The
most important of these raids was that led by Sidi Okba, who
traversed the whole of Algeria and Morocco, and who, no doubt,
would have gone on had he not been arrested by the Atlantic.</p>

<p>He was killed during his return journey by the Berber army under
Koceila, and he is buried near Biskra, where his memory is
venerated.</p>

<p>Hassan followed him, and finally drove the last Byzantines out
of North Africa. Needless to say, the chief object of the invaders
had been to convert the people to the new faith, and little by
little the Berbers became Mohammedans. It did not take long for
them to create dissension in these beliefs, but they remained
generally under the law of the Prophet, respecting the principles
even more rigidly than their conquerors.</p>

<p>However, the most important point of this conversion is that it
created an Arab-Berber alliance for the further march of
Mohammedanism into Europe. It is said that it was a Berber named
Tarik who first crossed the Straits of Gibraltar, and it was after
him that the rock took its name, Djebel el Tarik—the Mountain of
Tarik.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
</p>

<p>The Arabs and Berbers pressed on through Spain until they were
defeated by Charles Martel at Poitiers in 732 and retired into the
peninsula. The remains of their grandeur can be seen in the
glorious palaces and mosques at Seville, Cordova and Granada. But
the Berbers, being of an independent nature, did not readily accept
the laws and regulations of the allies. In the tenth century there
were a number of insurrections in Algeria, and the Fatimides, or
followers of the descendant of Fathma, the daughter of the prophet,
succeeded for a period in dominating the country. Unfortunately for
them their chief tried to go too far in his independence, and in
the twelfth century the Sultan at Cairo launched a punitive
expedition composed of the five tribes known as the Hilals.</p>

<p>Unlike the expeditions of the seventh century, these invaders
came in hordes, bringing with them their flocks and their
belongings, and sweeping mercilessly across the country, leaving
devastation behind. Arabs and Berbers united to oppose them, but to
no avail. Their armies poured over the land like a cloud of
locusts. The little that was left of Roman civilization was
destroyed, the cultivation disappeared, and North Africa was the
desert of over a thousand years before.</p>

<p>From this period until the end of the fifteenth century North
Africa was given over to pillage. With the exception of the cities
of Tunis, Tlemçen and Fez, anarchy seems to have reigned
everywhere, and there are no records or history of the period. The
Arab had shown his worth; the Arab as an administrator had no
qualification; he has not yet proved the contrary.</p>

<p>At first it was the Spaniards who took the place as rulers of
North Africa. They had gradually driven<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_27">[27]</span> the Mohammedans out of southern Spain, and
during the first ten years of the sixteenth century had occupied
the seaports from Oran right down to Bougie, including Algiers. But
these conquests did not really interest them as their eyes were
turned to the Indies. Moreover, in the meanwhile the brothers
Barbarossa were scouring the Mediterranean, and when they were
asked to rid Algeria of the Spaniards it did not take them long to
do it. But once the deed was accomplished, the Turks refused to
leave, and in 1546 took possession of Algiers.</p>

<p>For the next three hundred years the White City became the
stronghold of the pirates of the Mediterranean. At first their
fleet was nominally a national navy, fighting against Charles
Quint, but little by little all form of legitimate warfare
disappeared and open piracy became the sole occupation of these
wild seamen. Their ships became independent rovers of the sea;
built lighter and more handily than the average cargo- or
war-vessel of other nations, they fell upon their prey regardless
of its flag, captured it, and brought it back to Algiers. Here the
cargo was divided: a quarter to the state, and the rest to the
owner and crew of the vessel. The sailors or passengers on board
the prize were employed as slaves, those who knew trades, to build
and beautify the palaces of their masters, the more common to work
in the quarries or to row in the galleys. If they were men of
importance, they were held to ransom. Among other prisoners who
spent a not too pleasant sojourn in Algeria were Cervantes, the
author of <i>Don Quixote</i>, and the French poet Regnard.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before the powers in Europe began to
occupy themselves with these acts of open brigandage. In 1541,
Charles Quint led an expedition, but partly by reason of adverse
weather,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> and partly
by the strength of the Turkish lair, he was entirely defeated, and
just escaped with a small portion of his forces.</p>

<p>The squadron sent by Cromwell under Blake in 1655 fared better.
Part of the Turkish Fleet was destroyed at Tunis, and the release
of the British prisoners was obtained. Louis XIV sent two fleets in
1682 and 1688, under Duquesne and d’Estrès respectively, but,
though their bombardments did a good deal of damage to the
fortifications, and temporarily hampered the pirates’ activity, the
effect did not last long.</p>

<p>About the same time Sir Thomas Allen, and a little later Sir
Edward Spragg, inflicted minor defeats on the Turkish fleets, but
on the whole little harm was done; and though Lord Exmouth won a
decisive victory in 1816 and seriously battered the fortifications,
he was unable to land, and it remained for the French in 1830
finally to shake and destroy a rule which had dominated the
Mediterranean for three centuries. With their entry on to the
scene, the period of anarchy begun by the Vandals finally
disappeared, and the task almost completed by the Romans started
again on almost as barren a soil as that faced by the great
colonists of the Mediterranean a hundred years before Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c04"></a>CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="sc2">THE FRENCH CONQUEST OF ALGERIA</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">It will</span> be easily understood that this
undisputed mastery of the Mediterranean basin had given the Turks
of Algeria a very great impression of their importance, and had
left them with little respect for the European powers.
Consideration, therefore, for representatives of those powers was
on the same scale, and when one day the French Consul, Deval, paid
an official visit to the Dey Hussein to protest about the
non-payment of a debt to a French subject, Hussein summarily sent
him about his business with a flick over the face with his fan.</p>

<p>This took place in 1827, but it was not until 1830 that the
French really decided to have done with the insolence of the dey.
An army of thirty-five thousand men was organized under General
Bourmont, one of Napoleon’s officers, escorted by a fleet of three
hundred ships. Curiously enough the success of the expedition was
greatly facilitated by the lack of vigilance of British guards some
twenty years before.</p>

<p>In 1808 Napoleon had practically decided to conquer Algeria and
Colonel Boutin had been sent on a secret mission to Algiers with
orders to reconnoiter the land. During his return journey the ship
on which he was traveling was captured by a British man-of-war and
the Colonel was imprisoned at Malta.</p>

<p>He, however, succeeded in escaping, and, returning to France,
laid his report before the Emperor, who<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_30">[30]</span> had by that time decided that Egypt was a
more interesting goal.</p>

<p>Boutin’s plans were therefore put aside, but when the expedition
of 1830 was being prepared they came to light again and were
exclusively used in drawing up all the details of the attack.</p>

<p>Wisely avoiding the mistakes of their predecessors who had
attempted to take the stronghold itself, the fleet bearing the army
sailed to the west of Algiers, and in June, 1830, landed without
opposition in the sheltered bay of Sidi Ferruch. The cause of this
easy landing has never been clearly established, but it is supposed
that Hussein either believed that this invasion would share the
same fate as all others, and that by allowing the army to land his
victory would be more complete, or else that he did not anticipate
an attack from that quarter.</p>

<p>However, the fact remains that the whole of the French army
landed without difficulty, and that a few days later they were
marching on Algiers. They met the first elements of the Turkish
army at Staoueli. The battle was fierce, but the French artillery
caused havoc among the ranks of the Moslem troops, which were
driven out of their position. The French headquarters were
established on the site of the future Trappist monastery, which is
now a great wine-cellar.</p>

<p>The advance on Algiers was continued, but there were no roads,
and the hills of the Sahel were covered with thick scrub. On June
twenty-ninth, however, the army arrived before Algiers. The attack
on the fortress where Charles Quint had for a brief moment pitched
his tent was immediately commenced. For a time the Turks held out,
but, realizing the futility of their task, they set fire to the
powder-magazine and blew up the great pile, emblem of their long
rule. The French, meeting no longer with any opposition,
pushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> on, and on
July fifth made their triumphal entry into Algiers.</p>

<p>The immediate result of this victory was for the King of France,
Charles X, to lose his head. He believed that he was now in a
position to exercise absolute power, and he expressed himself by
publishing his famous <i>Ordonnances</i>. The consequence was
revolution. Charles X was deposed, and Louis Philippe, the son of
Philippe Egalité, mounted the throne. General Bourmont was relieved
of his post as Commander-in-Chief, giving way to General
Clauzel.</p>

<p>As can be imagined, this did not tend to help matters across the
Mediterranean. The capture of Algiers had taken barely a month—the
subduing of the Arabs was to drag on for over thirty years.</p>

<p>In the first place, the new Government in Paris was very
diffident about pushing forward the conquest of the country. At
first only the coast was occupied. This was interpreted by the
natives of the interior as fear, and it was with little difficulty
that the young Emir, Abd-el-Kader, raised the population to a holy
war. Until the year 1847 this struggle continued with varying
success, and it was not until Bugeaud, an old warrior of the First
Empire, took charge of the operations that the unruly chief began
to lose ground. The capture of his <i>smala</i> in 1843 at Taguine
in the Sersou was the beginning of the end. Four years later he
surrendered and was exiled, and he finally died at Damascus. His
memory is venerated by all the Arabs of the country.</p>

<p>Once the emir was out of the way, Bugeaud began to penetrate the
interior by colonization. His famous motto, <i>“Ense et
aratro,”</i> was to prove a veritable success, and little by little
the country began transforming itself. In the meanwhile he did not
neglect the conquest of the territory still unsubdued. In
1852<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> the Oasis of
Laghouat was captured after tedious fighting, and with it the
penetration of the Sahara began.</p>

<p>The last strongholds of the Berbers in the Kabyle Mountains fell
in 1857. The country seemed turning toward peace. But in 1864 a
fierce revolt burst forth in southern Oranie; the French punitive
column was massacred, and the rebellion spread all over the
department. It took five years to quell it completely.</p>

<p>Hardly was this over than the Franco-Prussian War broke out and
Algeria again became a center of agitation. The Kabyles for a short
space threatened the peace of the whole country, capturing numbers
of French centers and massacring the inhabitants. The French were
obliged to send troops back from France at a very awkward moment,
but they succeeded in quelling the insurrection. In 1879 the
Berbers of the Aurès made an attempt to rise, but were rapidly
repressed; the same lot awaited the insurgents of southern Oranie
in 1881. I can not pass this point in the history of the conquest
without mentioning a name great in the annals of Algeria though
sadly forgotten by many historians.</p>

<p>I refer to Cardinal Lavigerie, priest and administrator, founder
of the order of the Pères Blancs who did more by his foresight and
calm judgment to bring the Arabs under French rule than any
governor during these turbulent times. His political activities
were only eclipsed by his evangelical work, and his influence in
North Africa has ever remained.</p>

<p>Those who are interested in this subject will find some
excellent reading in <i>Le Cardinal Lavigerie et Son Action
Politique</i> by J. Tournin. This book not only deals with the
Cardinal’s long administration in North Africa but also throws much
light on all those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
intrigues which finally led to the disestablishment of the Church
in France.</p>

<p>Since then little has occurred to disturb the peace of Algeria,
and, in spite of a certain amount of unrest during the Great War,
there has been no definite rebellion.</p>

<p>The French conquest took long, but, when one looks at the
stupendous difficulties which had to be overcome, one is surprised
it was completed so rapidly. Everything was against it: an unstable
government, which was overthrown at the outset of the campaign by
an equally unstable rule, which itself disappeared a few years
later to give place to the adventures of the Second Empire;
statesmen who had no definite policy as regards North Africa, and
generals who never had sufficient troops nor a free enough hand
really to take up the conquest of the country seriously.</p>

<p>Opposing them was an enemy, composed of born fighters, knowing
the country as well as their horses, amazingly mobile, capable of
concentrating to fight a battle and dispersing again like the sand,
and inspired with the spirit of religious war. The country was
overgrown with thick brush; there were no roads, great mountains to
cross, and, once in the interior, no means of feeding or watering
the army, with no towns from which food or cattle could be
requisitioned, no wells or springs and a climate of great
extremes.</p>

<p>When one traverses the great plains of the Sersou and the Hauts
Plateaux leaning back in a comfortable car, or when trekking across
the Sahara to some known water-point among a friendly people, one
often wonders how it was possible for that small French column in
this unknown country to press on after an elusive enemy with lines
of communication of such immense length. There is no heroic record
of their achievements, and, apart from certain names
known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> to French
school-children, no one appears to have been honored or exalted as
responsible for this series of campaigns.</p>

<p>Let any trained soldier consider the taking of Laghouat, three
hundred miles south of Algiers, in a desert, unpopulated and
waterless, and he will wonder how it was done. The conquest of
Algeria by the French is one of the greatest pages of military
history.</p>

<h2><a id="c05"></a>CHAPTER V<br>
<span class="sc2">THE INHABITANTS TO-DAY</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">North Africa</span> has been very aptly
described as a melting-pot of the Mediterranean races, and, though
all trace of invaders such as the Vandals and the Byzantines have
vanished, the other peoples who came and conquered and were in turn
defeated have left their mark on the inhabitants of to-day.</p>

<p>The Phœnician, the Roman, the Arab, the Spaniard, the Turk, can
be seen in all parts of North Africa, and, though it requires
perhaps a little study and experience to place one’s hand on the
actual features of the past conquests, they are most striking when
one is shown them. The original race of the country is, however,
the Berber, and, in spite of these invasions which have devastated,
reinstated, and again devastated his country, he has remained in a
good many districts as pure as the Celts.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, it can be said that to-day the pure Berbers
are found in all the highest mountains, such as the Aurès above
Biskra, the Kabyle country, and that portion of the Tellian Atlas
known as the Ouarsenis, strongholds to which they returned during
the various invasions, and where they remained unassailable while
the tide of war ebbed and flowed beneath them. The people of the
Mzab and the Touaregs of the Hoggar are also pure Berbers: in the
case of the former because they were determined to remain pure and
exiled themselves in the merciless desert, and in the latter
because they were too far<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_36">[36]</span> away to be touched by invasion. In other
parts of Algeria intermarriage naturally took place during the
various dominations, but, though Roman and Turkish traces remain,
these are eclipsed by those of the Arabs.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, therefore, it can be said that the groups of
pure Berbers are located in the high mountains, in the Mzab and in
the Hoggar; that the Berber influence is predominant among the
people who inhabit the country immediately south of Algiers, as far
as the southern slopes of the Atlas, the department of Constantine,
and an arm of the southern territories running from Biskra down to
Ouargla and the great belt of desert running right across the
Sahara from the Atlantic to Tripoli on a latitude just south of El
Golea.</p>

<p>The whole of the rest of the country—that is, the department of
Oran, the whole of the southern tracts of the department of Alger,
and the rest of the southern territories other than the belt named
above— is decidedly Arab. The Berber is there, but the influence is
almost entirely that of the nomad invader.</p>

<p>If you ask an intelligent native what his nationality is, he
will reply that he is an Arab who has been slightly Berberized or
else he will say that he is a noble Arab—that is to say, a claimant
to direct descent from Mohammed. While on this subject it is
interesting to note what the conception of nobility is among these
people. Outwardly, before the European, it is the title of <i>bash
agha</i> or <i>agha</i> or <i>caïd</i>, but in reality this does
not count with the people any more than Lord-Lieutenant of a county
in England. To them it is merely a title imposed by the French,
which they must respect just as they must respect the Colonel or
the <i>Administrateur</i>. Aristocracy to them is the descent from
the Prophet, or as one wise old gentleman once said:</p>

<p>Scene of Arab Life</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
</p>

<p>“To many of us nobility can be achieved by much learning.”</p>

<p>In other words, the scarlet burnous and the loud-sounding title
would carry no weight if it were not enforced by the French
authority.</p>

<p>To-day, therefore, the inhabitants of Algeria are Arabs and
Berbers of whom fifty per cent. claim almost pure Berber blood, and
Frenchmen. There are many Spaniards in the department of Oran, and
in the east a fair sprinkling of Italians and Maltese. The Jews,
too, form an important section of the community; those who live in
the north wear European dress, and in the south most of them wear
Arab costume, with a certain little difference in the burnous, and
in some districts they have robes peculiar to themselves. Their
women, even in some families of the north, keep the dress of their
people, the embroidered kerchief about the head and the rather
shapeless frock. By a law known as the Décret Crémieux, voted in
1871, to facilitate the conscription of recruits for the
Franco-Prussian War, all Jews north of a certain latitude in
Algeria automatically became French citizens. It was not very
popular at the time, but its consequences now are much appreciated.
In spite, however, of this French citizenship and all the wealth
acquired in commerce, the Jews of Algeria have kept themselves
strangely apart. Even in Algiers all their shops are in a certain
quarter; they close without exception on Saturday, and attend the
synagogue with the utmost regularity. They never intermarry, and
they form as distinct a race as the Arabs. In fact, in many
districts—and especially in the south—they are always referred to
as Israelites. Sometimes they are persecuted, but this merely knits
them closer together. They despise the Arabs, but fear them, and
tremble at any sign of force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
</p>

<p>The Arabs equally despise the Jews, but unfortunately they have
got themselves rather into their hands through making use of them
as money-lenders.</p>

<p>The actual French occupation of the land does not penetrate very
far—in fact, in a great many areas the Frenchman is leaving the
interior and returning to the coast. Again and again one passes
through European villages with a church built to accommodate a
thousand people or so, and one sees about twenty European dwellings
in the town and the rest of the houses in ruins or inhabited by
Arabs. What has caused this? Primarily, the inherent dislike of the
Frenchman to expatriate himself. If he comes to Algeria it is with
no idea of spending the rest of his days here. His one idea is to
make enough money to permit him to return home to France and eke
out a pinched existence in his native village, but with the
satisfaction of being a <i>rentier</i>. Secondly, the rather
ungrateful task of cultivating in a country where all depends on
the rainfall. It is all right for the man who has capital and who
can bide his time to pay off his losses of the bad year with the
profits of the good, but it is heart-breaking work for the small
landowner. Of course there are numbers of families who have settled
in the cultivated regions and who have become Algerian, but they
are the exception; their names can be counted off rapidly.</p>

<p>These men have great fortunes in wine, in cereals and tobacco,
and their children have in many cases never seen France; but,
generally speaking, the Frenchman is not a colonist, and it is
very, very rare to see him away in the Sahara sheep-breeding or
alfa-collecting. He has, however, done one rather contradictory
thing in imposing his language on practically the whole country.
With the exception of the nomads who wander about the Sahara, it is
rare to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> to any
center and not find a French-speaking population.</p>

<p>The Arabs among themselves of course speak their own language;
it is a strange dialect based on pure Arabic, but peculiar to North
Africa.</p>

<p>Moreover, it differs in accent according to regions. For
instance, the language of the south is much deeper and more
guttural than that of Algiers, and the talk in Constantine and
Oran, again, has many words and intonations not found in other
centers.</p>

<p>I think that the correct name for this dialect should be
Arabo-Berber. There is, of course, also the pure Berber spoken by
the people of the Kabyle and Aurès Mountains, of the Mzab and the
Hoggar; and, though Berbers are often found who can not speak
anything else, it is almost a general rule to find them
bilinguists, while the majority talk French too. It is interesting
to note that when the Sultan of Zanzibar came to North Africa the
only people with whom he could speak fluently were the Berbers of
the Mzab.</p>

<p>The Jews speak both Arab and French fluently; their Arab is
often purer than that of the actual natives. A great number speak
Hebrew among themselves.</p>

<p>However, to progress comfortably through the country, French is
essential, and Arabo-Berber is a great help and inspires confidence
among the people. Grammatically, it is a simple language, but the
pronunciation is difficult and the number of words which mean the
same thing requires one to have command over a large vocabulary. It
is a language that can be learned only with a teacher.</p>

<p>These, therefore, are the peoples and the tongues of North
Africa, and, armed with this knowledge, we can now penetrate
further into the system of administration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c06"></a>CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="sc2">FRENCH ADMINISTRATION OF ALGERIA</span></h2>

<h3>1. <em>Civilian</em></h3>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> administration of any country to a
foreigner is always rather incomprehensible, but the manner in
which Algeria is administered by the French is more than a
surprise.</p>

<p>It is not our duty to criticize the method of government of this
country, and let it be said at once that, strange as the method may
seem, the results are admirable.</p>

<p>To the uninitiated, Algeria is a colony such as Kenya or the
Gold Coast, with a Governor and all the general system of working
dominions beyond the seas. But, though the country is administered
by a Governor-General, he does not, as might be supposed, depend on
the Colonial Office, neither do any of his reports pass through the
hands of the Colonial Secretary. His tenure of office is, moreover
most uncertain, and he is only appointed for a period of six months
at a time, renewable at the end of each period, and this
appointment is made by the Home Office (<i>Ministère de
l’Intérieur</i>) in Paris, under whose jurisdiction he is.</p>

<p>At first this contradiction of things seems hard to understand,
and one is forced to penetrate further into the inner workings of
Algeria to understand. In the first place, North Africa—with the
exception of Tunisia and Morocco, which are
protectorates—is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
divided into three departments, with practically the same
organization as in France. That is to say, each department sends to
the Parliament in Paris one senator and two deputies, who are
elected by the French inhabitants of the country and by those Arabs
who have opted for French nationality.</p>

<p>These departments have their <i>préfets</i> and
<i>sous-préfets</i>, as in France, and the towns their mayors, with
the municipal council, <i>juges de paix</i>, <i>commissaires de
police</i>, etc. Thus up to this point the system of administration
in the three departments is identical with that in the mother
country.</p>

<p>The first slight difference we come upon is in the case of what
are known as <i>communes mixtes</i>. These centers are those where
the Arab population is in excess of the French. In this case the
mayor is replaced by an <i>administrateur</i>. The area covered by
the jurisdiction of this individual is much larger than the
<i>commune</i> under the mayor, and comprises numerous
<i>douars</i>, or native villages. The <i>administrateur</i>, who
wears a vague uniform, something between that of an officer and a
lion-tamer, is trained specially for his post. He is assisted in
his duties by an <i>administrateur adjoint</i> and by a
<i>commission municipale</i>. This <i>commission municipale</i> is
composed partly of Frenchmen elected in the area of the <i>commune
mixte</i>, and partly of Arabs belonging to the various
<i>douars</i>, who are appointed by the Governor-General. The
<i>caïds</i> and other Arab chiefs—of whom we will speak
later—assist the <i>administrateur</i> as his agents in their
respective areas.</p>

<p>The <i>administrateur</i> himself has certain powers of
jurisdiction over Arabs, but all those who are French citizens have
recourse to the ordinary civil power.</p>

<p>This, therefore, in a few words is the system of administration
of Algeria proper, and it would all<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_42">[42]</span> seem quite simple if we did not suddenly come
face to face with the Governor-General. Here, in the midst of all
this peaceful organization associated with the Great Revolution, we
have Monsieur Le Gouverneur-Général, with his summer palace, his
staff, his aides-de-camp, naval and military, flying the tricolor
on his motor-car, while the guard turns out and presents arms. What
has he to do with all the senators and deputies and
<i>préfets</i>?</p>

<p>The answer is simple. For all practical purposes, nothing. He
himself may be a French senator with his seat in the upper chamber;
at the end of six months he may become a minister or he may be
politely dismissed. And how often has the post of Governor-General
of Algeria been held by some high functionary not wanted in France,
or by one who is merely biding his time to take office again. The
Governor-General, therefore, unless he be a man of exceptional
value, can not really do very much for or against the welfare of
the country, and the most important duties therefore devolve on a
permanent official known as the <i>Secrétaire Général du
Gouvernement</i>.</p>

<p>This gentleman—though he is usually not a man of great ambition,
otherwise he would not be in this thankless post—has a great
working knowledge of the country and its people, and it is he who
keeps his superior in touch with all that is going on. But even he
has nothing to do with the French civil administration, which
belongs entirely to France.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are three assemblies over which the
Governor presides and which carry out on their own account a
certain amount of the administration of the country. They are the
<i>Conseil du Gouvernement</i>, dealing chiefly with the building
of new villages, making of roads and railways, and
generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span> opening up
the colony; the <i>Délégations Financières</i>, composed of French
colonists, French taxpayers, and a certain number of well-to-do
Arabs. These financial delegates discuss the budget for Algeria,
which incidentally, and contradictorily, is independent of France,
as is also the Bank of Algeria, which prints its own banknotes.
Finally we have the <i>Conseil Supérieur</i> composed of twenty-two
members: the <i>Procureur-Général</i>, the Admiral, the
<i>préfets</i> and a few Arabs of importance who meet once a year
under the presidency of the Governor-General to vote the budget for
Algeria.</p>

<p>But even here the Parliament in Paris is afraid of letting the
wretched colony look after itself, and it insists upon ratifying
the budget, without knowing anything about it.</p>

<p>Algeria, therefore, is not a colony, but part of France,
administered in the same way as any French department, but under
the care of the Governor-General appointed by the Home Office, who
is all-powerful without having any real authority at all. The
<i>communes</i> are French or <i>mixtes</i>; the Arabs have a
certain say in the government, but not much; the budget is
separate, but under the scrutiny of the Palais Bourbon.</p>

<h3>2. <em>Military</em></h3>

<p>All this seems complicated enough, but the mystery is not
over—it deepens as we leave the northern districts of Algeria and
move south. We have now seen the rôles of the various functionaries
in the three departments of Constantine, Alger and Oranie, and we
must turn to the area known as the Territoires du Sud.</p>

<p>The actual boundary between the departments and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span> these southern territories
varies somewhat, but it can be said roughly that anywhere two
hundred miles from the coast one has passed out of civil control
and into military. Thence these territories stretch away across the
Sahara until the Niger is reached—great, open spaces with small
fertile points where there is water. All this waste land is also
under the Governor-General and his permanent staff in Algiers.
There is one slight difference. Whereas if he were to make a speech
to the townsfolk of some smiling vine center near Algiers he must
ask the <i>Secrétaire-Général</i> for the necessary data to address
the multitudes, in the south he applies to the <i>Directeur des
Territoires du Sud</i>. This functionary, who is often intelligent,
has an enviable post, and if he is interested in the Great South,
with its strange people, he can make a study under very
advantageous circumstances. Here again, however, we have an
anomaly, for, though the <i>Directeur des Territoires du Sud</i> is
responsible for their order, his administrators are all soldiers
and the country south of the civil territory is under the strictest
form of martial law. A little explanation on the system of
government will perhaps make matters clearer.</p>

<p>The southern areas are divided into what are known as <i>Cercles
Militaires</i>, and they may cover an area of one hundred square
miles. The <i>Cercle</i> is under a colonel and is subdivided into
<i>annexes</i>, each under a captain, who is responsible to the
colonel for his area. There are a number of officers attached to
these annexes, all specially trained in their duties—in fact, from
the colonel down, all the staff have passed through the school of
the <i>affaires indigènes</i> and have spent practically all their
life in the south. For the future we will refer to the military
administration as the Bureau Arabe, the name under which it goes in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span> south. To all
intents and purposes the Bureau Arabe is all-powerful. Fines,
fatigues, prison for all persons not having a European status are
entirely in its hands. The court-martial convened has the power of
life and death over the same category of persons; only Europeans
and naturalized Arabs can appeal to the civil courts. The rule is
harsh, sometimes unjust—it depends on the staff of the Bureau
Arabe. The military in the various oases are commanded by
regimental officers who have really nothing to do with the Bureau
Arabe; they are just in the garrison as they might be in Algiers or
Marseilles. But if the head of the <i>annexe</i> requires them for
any administrative or punitive purpose they are at his
disposal.</p>

<p>A flock of sheep disappears, the owner complains, and, if he is
considered sufficiently important to take notice of, a section of
<i>spahis</i> is sent off to trace the flock. Some one has to be
ejected from his house—an N.C.O. and four tirailleurs carry out the
unpleasant duty.</p>

<p>Unless an Arab carries a great deal of weight he is helpless if
the Bureau Arabe decides against him. Apart from this, however, the
chief of the <i>annexe</i> has other more peaceful and useful
duties. He has all the functions of the mayor to perform, and is
surrounded by a municipal council. These worthies— who are partly
Arabs, partly French and partly Jews—vote silly laws such as
traffic regulations for the non-existent vehicles. They decide
whether the main street shall be painted green or gold; they vote
money to repair the roof of the colonel’s house. Their most
important function is the distribution of water in the oasis. This,
as will be explained in a later chapter, is a question of life and
death in the long Sahara summer, and it requires infinite care to
arrange it all. But, apart from this, the municipal<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> council does little, and, though
the <i>Chef d’Annexe</i> occasionally performs a civil marriage,
the law and order of the Great South rests in the hands of the
military.</p>

<p>I use the word <i>order</i> purposely, as it is through their
presence that we can travel safely over those magnificent roads
which they also have made across the rolling plains. For, though
justice is sometimes miscarried, there is little chance of the
bandit escaping if he commits highway robbery or murder on the
roads of the Bureau Arabe.</p>

<p>These are, therefore, the pros and cons, and let it be said for
these colonels and captains who have spent all the best years of
their lives in the Sahara, that they are confronted by great
difficulties, and that until the day when the Arab is emancipated
and set on the same footing as his conquerors, the only method by
which an end can be achieved is severity.</p>

<p>So far it will seem that we have left the realm of complication
and entered that of straightforward government. A mere
illusion.</p>

<p>Living in the same town and almost next door to the Bureau
Arabe, we find the Juge de Paix, the Notaire, and the Commissaire
de Police. What the first two can do to justify their existence is
beyond the imagination. The Commissaire has functions which he
exercises, but which seem quite unnecessary, as in all his actions
he is entirely paralyzed by the Bureau Arabe.</p>

<p>For instance, if some petty crime is committed he can
investigate it, but he can not condemn without the authority of the
<i>Chef d’Annexe</i>. If one requires a gun-license one has to
apply to the Commissaire de Police, but he must go to the Bureau
Arabe to get it. He is in charge of the few native policemen who
wander about the oases in search of crime and bribes,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> but, though the prison is next
door to his office, it is guarded by the military.</p>

<p>It is all the same curious system which causes the
Governor-General’s powers—extending across the Sahara, to the verge
of Central Africa—to depend on the Home Office in Paris.</p>

<p>Moreover, we have not yet finished with all these different
forms of administration, and in the next chapter I shall try to
explain how the native functionaries aid in the government of the
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c07"></a>CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="sc2">ARAB ADMINISTRATION</span></h2>

<h3>1. <em>Through the Arab Chiefs</em></h3>

<p><span class="sc">It can</span> be said that in the northern
districts of Algeria, where civilian rule is supreme, the Arab
chief’s position is more honorary than anything else. It is true
that he holds the same titles as his brethren in the south and that
he is responsible for an area comprising many <i>douars</i>, but
his authority is very limited owing to his constant contact with
the local <i>administrateurs</i>.</p>

<p>In the south it is very different. Here we are among the nomad
tribes, who, though they have certain fixed limits of pasturage,
roam over vast areas and great tracts of land, rarely remaining one
week in the same place.</p>

<p>It would therefore be materially impossible for any European
administration to deal directly with these people always on the
move, and who have dialects and pronunciation which only an Arab
can understand.</p>

<p>The French Government, therefore, appoints Arab chiefs, who, to
all intents and purposes, rule over the nomads, and who are
responsible for law and order among the people and for the levying
of taxes. The head of the Arab chiefs, who is ruler over the whole
tribe or confederation of tribes, is known as the <i>bash agha</i>.
He is appointed by the Governor-General, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_49">[49]</span> he is chosen for his authority, for his
capacity as an administrator and for the name he bears.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, however, that though the Government tries
as far as possible to appoint men of noble lineage, this is not
necessarily done, and the Government does not recognize any sort of
official succession from father to son. If the eldest son is
considered worthy of the post he is probably appointed to take his
father’s place, but cases occur where a distant relation, and
sometimes an Arab chief of another family is brought in, if the
actual ruling house is considered unworthy.</p>

<p>The <i>bash agha</i> has under him one or two <i>aghas</i> whom
he recommends to the Bureau Arabe for appointment. One of the
<i>aghas</i> is often his eldest son, but here again there is no
rule.</p>

<p>The confederation of tribes is divided into subtribes, which,
though they each have their own name, all belong to the main clan.
These differ in numbers, but the confederation is usually composed
of from ten to twenty tribes. These tribes are estimated by the
numbers of tents or heads of families they contain. They each
represent about two thousand people and have at their head a
<i>caïd</i>. It is, moreover, interesting to note that the <i>bash
agha</i> and the <i>aghas</i> belong to one of these tribes of
which they are honorary chiefs.</p>

<p>The <i>caïd</i> is, as in the case of the <i>agha</i>,
recommended by the <i>bash agha</i> to the Bureau Arabe, who, if
agreeable to the recommendation, passes it on to the
Governor-General for confirmation. Here, again, they try as far as
possible to select the <i>caïds</i> from the same family as the
<i>bash agha</i>. The appointment of the <i>caïd</i> is most
important, as it is he who is in direct touch with the tribe
wherever it happens to be. He is assisted in his duties by the
<i>khaliphat</i>, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
does all the clerical work and who acts in the place of the
<i>caïd</i> when he is absent.</p>

<p>The <i>caïd’s</i> tribe is subdivided into four or five
“fractions,” each under a <i>sheik</i>. The <i>sheik</i>—about whom
so much fantastic literature has been written, and who, though he
may be a cultivated man, is usually so by accident—has a small
command, and his authority depends on his personality. He can
usually neither speak nor write French, and to the casual visitor
differs in no way exteriorly from the poorest shepherd in his
“fraction.” In fact, with the exception of a few <i>aghas</i> and
<i>caïds</i> who are rich and who have come in contact with Europe,
the Arab chief, with his silk-decked tent and his <i>smala</i> of
glorious beauties, wielding the powers of life and death at a
moment’s notice, is a thing of the past. He shambles along on a
rickety horse reminding one rather of the bull-ring, and he lives
most of his life under a kind of awning which he calls a tent.</p>

<p>Since the war, the Government insists that the chiefs it
appoints shall have passed the elementary standard at the local
French school, but there are many <i>caïds</i> of pre-war
nomination who are completely illiterate and who have never lived
anywhere but in a tent. Moreover, the official power of a chief is
very limited. He is merely a functionary paid by the Government to
assist it in its administrative duties in the south, and with this
end in view he has the support of all those in authority.</p>

<p>Officially this is all. Unofficially there is a great deal more
power wielded in the background, power used sometimes quite
unscrupulously to attain a personal end. For example, the Bureau
Arabe only recognizes the <i>bash agha</i> and his subordinates. A
crime occurs among the nomads, the <i>caïd</i> of the tribe
concerned is notified, and he sets about making his<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> investigations. On his report
alone the Bureau Arabe will act. There are, of course, many of
these men who are scrupulously honest and who carry out their
duties conscientiously, but there are others who do not, and there
are certainly frequent miscarriages of justice through personal
reasons.</p>

<p>There was a case where the <i>agha</i> had a feud with a
<i>sheik</i> of his tribe. The <i>sheik</i> was in the right; the
<i>sheik</i> tried to make trouble for the <i>agha</i>, and
appealed to the French authority. The French authority gave the
<i>sheik</i> his right.</p>

<p>The <i>agha</i> said nothing at the time, but a few weeks later
he sent the <i>sheik</i> on a mission, and while he was away he
took his wife and kept her till he thought the vengeance
sufficient. The <i>sheik</i> was powerless to act, as the
<i>agha</i> had committed no crime in the eyes of the French law,
and he knew if he made any more fuss that his life would not be
safe. It is better for a nomad to keep in with his <i>caïd</i> if
he does not want to lose all he has.</p>

<p>Of course these cases are mainly exceptions, and the average
<i>caïd</i> does his duty conscientiously. There is one I know well
who looks after his people so seriously that he is actually out of
pocket when the end of the year comes round. The point to bring
out, though, is the danger of giving too much power to people whose
idea of justice is very primitive, and who in cases of vengeance
are quite unscrupulous. Life and death to an Arab are less
important than the evening meal, and it is difficult to say what
would happen if ever they were given autonomy. It is a delicate
question.</p>

<p>For the moment we must continue our examination of native
administration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
</p>

<h3>2. <em>Through the Arab Functionaries</em></h3>

<p>Quite apart from the official chiefs appointed to assist the
Bureau Arabe in the enforcement of the law, there are a number of
functionaries who have nothing whatever to do with the French civil
or military government of the country.</p>

<p>These functionaries exercise their duties in the north as well
as in the south, wherever there are believing Mohammedans. They are
appointed, of course, with the approval of the Governor-General,
but they are chosen chiefly for their knowledge of Moslem laws and
rites. In the north, as in the south, they are under the Arab
chiefs, but their rulings on purely Arab questions are as final as
those of a French civil or military court, and their religious
doctrines are based on deep study of the laws of the Prophet.</p>

<p>They are divided into two categories. In the first are those who
administer the law, in the second, those whose duties are
religious. The young men who qualify for posts in the first
category are those whose parents feel that they have a calling for
higher things than being shepherds or laborers. While still
learning the Koran by heart with the native teacher they are sent
to the French school with the definite object of working. Here they
are taught all elementary matters in the same way as a European
child in a boarding-school, and at the age of sixteen they go up
for an examination which, if they pass, gives them an entry into
the Medersa.</p>

<p>The Medersa is a college in Algiers where the students study
Mohammedan law for a period of six years. Some of those who pass
carry their studies further, and go up for the examination for the
French bar, but to those who are not so ambitious there are two
openings. They can either become Interprètes<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_53">[53]</span> Judiciaires—that is to say, interpreters
in French courts, where Moslem law comes into contact with French
law—or else they can definitely take up the Droit Musulman as a
profession.</p>

<p>If the student merely passes out unbrilliantly, or even fails to
get his diploma, he will probably become a <i>khodja</i> in a
Bureau Arabe or in some other French office dealing with Arabs. His
duties will be to translate into Arabic all official despatches
sent out to the tribes or <i>douars</i>, and likewise to translate
into French all incoming Arab documents.</p>

<p>A successful candidate will, however, first of all find himself
appointed to the post of <i>adel</i>, a kind of superior clerk in a
native lawyer’s office, and from that he can rise to <i>bash
adel</i>, or principal clerk. From the <i>bash adels</i> are chosen
the <i>kadis</i>. The <i>kadis</i> have many functions, which in
England would combine the duties of solicitor, official receiver,
registrar, and judge, without the latter’s power of awarding
punishment.</p>

<p>All native cases of jurisdiction are first of all brought before
the <i>caïds</i> and <i>aghas</i> of the district. If they are
crimes or cases with which he can not deal by compromise, he either
sends them on to the Bureau Arabe or, if they are not criminal
offenses, to the <i>kadi</i>. People who require arbitration can,
of course, go direct to the <i>kadi</i>, but the nomad prefers the
ruling of his <i>caïd</i>. The most usual cases to come before the
<i>kadi</i> are those of inheritance, lawsuits, sales of property,
and family quarrels. He also marries and divorces those who wish
it.</p>

<p>His decision is final, and even in questions between great
chiefs they must either accept the <i>kadi’s</i> ruling or else
carry the case before the French tribunals, which is a lengthy and
expensive procedure. In fact the <i>kadi</i> is the decisive factor
in all native disputes, in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_54">[54]</span> all family matters, and in all cases which do
not actually incur definite punishment.</p>

<p>The <i>kadis</i> themselves are usually charming people,
cultivated, courteous, and full of a quiet sense of humor gathered
amidst the comedies and tragedies of daily life which pass before
them. Many of them have a great deal of moral influence, and are
instrumental in bringing about reconciliations between foolish
couples and quarreling families.</p>

<p>There are also learned men, called <i>talebs</i>, in Mohammedan
centers. These natives teach the Koran in the schools and counsel
others who want advice in legal matters. They have also the
important function of writing and translating documents and letters
for those illiterate natives who require their services, whether it
be in French or in Arabic. On the same plane as the <i>kadi</i>,
but without the same official education, are found those of the
second category, mentioned above—the religious teachers.</p>

<p>First of all the <i>mufti</i>. The <i>muftis</i> often have had
a legal education and are consulted on Mohammedan law before taking
cases before the <i>kadi</i>, in the same way as in England one
goes to a solicitor, but they are chiefly authorities on religious
rites, and they hold official positions at the mosques. Every
Friday and on feast days they preach and expound the Koran at the
midday and evening prayer. Their power has greatly diminished of
late but their knowledge of Mohammedan scripture is profound. In
cases where there is no <i>mufti</i> the <i>kadi</i> is regarded as
the authority on religious matters.</p>

<p>The priest of the mosque is called the <i>imam</i>. He is in
charge of all religious ceremonies, and when the collective prayer
is said, the faithful follow him in all the chants and movements.
He is sometimes an educated man, but it is not the general rule,
and one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> often finds
the <i>imam</i> attending classes held by the <i>taleb</i> to learn
how to write and speak literary Arabic. (Literary Arabic in
opposition to the bastard tongue spoken in North Africa.)</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>Then there is the <i>muezzin</i>, who is the verger of the
mosque, and whose chief duty is to call the faithful to prayer.</p>

<p>There is no special costume for these different officials, but
they usually wear somber or white burnouses, and one can always
tell a learned man by the delicacy of his hands.</p>

<p>What strikes one most in all this Mohammedan administration is
that it has not altered since the beginning of its creation, and
that it has not been in the least degree influenced by contact with
laws or customs of other countries.</p>

<p>Even in matters where the application of modern laws would be
beneficial, such as in the question of inheritance which causes the
greatest muddle imaginable, the old system of twelve hundred years
ago is adhered to.</p>

<p>Now previously we noticed the apparent contradiction in the
French administration of Algeria, which seemed to be rather
overgoverned, and here we have another contradiction in the fact
that these native functionaries are allowed to act with complete
independence in all matters affecting their own laws. This is one
of France’s wisest policies in Algeria, and it is of comparatively
recent date.</p>

<p>At first the French did not realize the enormous importance of
Islam in North Africa, but now that they have grasped it, they use
their knowledge sagaciously.</p>

<p>The French administration of Algeria is complex, but it achieves
its end, as the traveler will realize if, on marvelous roads, he
traverses this immense country<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_56">[56]</span> unmolested by the masses of wild men who live
there.</p>

<p>I repeat again it is not the duty of a foreigner to criticize
the government of another country, but merely to examine it and
judge of the results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c08"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br>
<span class="sc2">MARABOUTS</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Standing</span> alone and quite apart from the
native officials just mentioned are the <i>marabouts</i>. The name
is derived from the Arab word <i>marabet</i>, which originally
meant one who served as a soldier in a <i>rebat</i> or fortress
built on the frontier of Mohammedan countries as defense against
the infidel, and which became a base of attack against Christian
neighbors.</p>

<p>In the forts the moslem soldiers gave themselves over to acts of
piety. When the days of holy war had passed the <i>rebats</i> were
converted into religious buildings, and a <i>marabet</i> was,
therefore, a holy man, an apostle of Mohammed.</p>

<p><i>Marabouts</i> in North Africa are now holy men who claim
direct descent from Mohammed. There are a few who by that virtue
alone become <i>marabouts</i>, and it can be imagined, therefore,
that there are a considerable number of these saints in Algeria.
Any Arab village which respects itself has a <i>marabout</i> or two
buried in the cemetery, and a great many have them living on the
premises. They have no official position, and their influence
depends entirely on their own personality. In some cases they are
great figures wielding an enormous amount of power, which is
utilized by the French Government for its own ends, and they are
incidentally treated with much consideration.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as practically all the male children of
<i>marabouts</i> inherit the title, there are many<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> who are completely
insignificant, I will even say unscrupulous and immoral, and who
live on what they can make out of the poor and credulous followers
of the Prophet. They are not always educated, and though they have
probably studied the Koran their knowledge on other matters is very
rudimentary. Many of them profess to be doctors, and though their
methods are very primitive, wonderful cures have been known at
their hands, chiefly owing to the faith of those treated.</p>

<p>They are almost all rich men, owning flocks in the
sheep-breeding areas, date-palms in the far south, and extensive
properties in the north. This wealth comes from the offerings of
the faithful in return for blessings and prayers for their
welfare.</p>

<p>This, of course, leads to a great deal of abuse, and there are
very many of these holy men who reap in hoards of wealth which they
spend on sumptuous living. Moreover, as it is supposed to be an act
of grace to be in the following of a <i>marabout</i> their servants
are not paid, and are practically slaves whose lives are in the
hands of their master. They are beaten or punished at will with no
redress, as it is rare that information leaks out officially to the
French authorities, who prefer to interfere as little as possible
with these holy men, whose religion seems, in their own eyes, to
absolve them from all acts of unrighteousness.</p>

<p>They drink alcohol, they rape, they live in the utmost disorder,
imposing unscrupulously on the believing faithful. If they find
people who oppose them they cast spells on them or curse them into
eternity, and the number of credulous folk who believe in this is
extraordinary.</p>

<p>Some of them are good at sleight of hand and perform childish
conjuring tricks which leave their followers in a state of
gibbering astonishment. I<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_59">[59]</span> remember once confounding a fairly decent
type of <i>marabout</i> who conjured before me by explaining the
trick. But, though he was rather upset, I saw that the people’s
faith was not in the least shaken. Naturally the well-to-do Arabs
of good family do not respect these law-breaking saints, and say
that though their ancestry must be considered, they can not be
regarded as real <i>marabouts</i>, whose lives are examples to all
the faithful.</p>

<p>However, against these rogues there are many exceptions: men of
great piety who spend a good deal of time and money in relieving
the suffering of the poor, and who have devoted a great part of
their existence to the study of sacred writings, while in practise
they strictly follow the principles of the Koran.</p>

<p>All <i>marabouts</i>, disorderly or otherwise, are at the head
of what is known as a <i>zaouia</i>. A <i>zaouia</i> is supposed to
be a kind of retreat for men and women, but chiefly women, who are
tired of worldly things. They give up all they have, be it one
sheep or a large-acred property, to the <i>marabout</i>, and in
return are clothed, lodged and fed for the rest of their lives in
spiritual beatitude. They also have to work, tilling his land,
looking after his horses, weaving carpets and burnouses, etc., the
produce of their work being nominally used to raise further money
to help the needy.</p>

<p>In the case of the conscientious <i>marabouts</i> this is done,
but the practise is also a source of personal revenue to the
unscrupulous. However, good and bad alike, they all have that Arab
spirit of hospitality and charity, and any person, rich or poor,
can always claim lodging and board with the blessing of the holy
man.</p>

<p>The <i>zaouias</i> are occasionally a sort of seminary where
young men who wish to be <i>muftis</i> or <i>imams</i><span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> go to study, but since the
creation of competitive examinations at the Medersa the pupils of
the teaching <i>zaouias</i> have greatly diminished.</p>

<p>Occasionally one comes across female <i>marabouts</i>. As a
general rule they are not much respected by the educated Arabs, and
their field of action lies chiefly among the poor women who believe
that they have miraculous powers to cure diseases and ward off the
evil eye. These women are sometimes, though not always, the wives
of <i>marabouts</i>, and they are also the children of holy men who
have no sons. There have been two very notable ladies of maraboutic
standing, Lalla Zineb, of El Hamel, near Bou Saada, and Lalla
Aurelie Tidjani, of Aïn Mahdi, near Laghouat.</p>

<p>The <i>marabout</i> is married in exactly the same way as any
other Arab, and if he is sufficiently wealthy he keeps a
well-stocked harem. Cases occur when the sons of <i>marabouts</i>
do not take on their father’s title but live like ordinary
citizens. There are also a few descendants of the Prophet who have
never been <i>marabouts</i> because they say that their ancestors
were never inspired by Heaven; but, generally speaking, the
position of a holy saint is too tempting to let slip by.</p>

<p>I have a great friend who is a <i>marabout</i>. His name is Hadj
Mohktar, and he lives at Chellala, on the rolling plain above the
Sahara. He is a dignified old gentleman, about sixty years old;
though like most Arabs he does not know his age. His eyes, which
are piercingly black, twinkle merrily when he is amused; he has a
good sense of humor and a brain far superior to that of most of his
caste.</p>

<p>He has been twice to Mecca, but this does not stop him from
drinking a glass of wine when it is offered to him. He is rich and
has some of the finest flocks in North Africa.</p>

<p>One night, hearing that I was at the hotel, he came<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> up to see me after dinner. I
offered him some champagne, which he drank with evident pleasure.
After a little preliminary talk about the prospects of
sheep-breeding that year, he asked me if I would care to take a
walk with him in the village. I accepted, expecting to be taken to
a gathering of learned <i>muftis</i>, but to my surprise we wended
our way to the reserved quarters of the native dancing-girls. Our
entry into the house we sought caused, to say the least of it, a
sensation. The girls precipitated themselves towards the old man
and kissed his shoulder and his turban. Cushions were brought,
carpets and rugs, and a throne was made for him. I was accommodated
with a stool at his feet. A tray was brought with honey cakes and
milk, but the <i>marabout</i> waved it all away.</p>

<p>“Bring me beer,” he commanded.</p>

<p>Beer was brought and we solemnly clinked glasses. Dancing-girls
from the neighboring houses appeared and kissed his turban. A few
men drifted in, but seeing who was present, discreetly
disappeared.</p>

<p>The <i>marabout</i> turned to me solemnly and said: “In your
country do you have dancing-girls as in North Africa?”</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>“Neither did we before the French came. Your people have much
wisdom,” he replied. “They are Christians, are they not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “but there are also Jews in my country, and in
our dominions there are Mohammedans and Hindus and Buddhists.”</p>

<p>The old man’s eyes fixed themselves on me.</p>

<p>“But are there, then, other sects than Mohammedan, Christian,
and Jew?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” I went on, and I tried to give him a rough outline of
the other faiths of the world. He listened to me in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
</p>

<p>“You are very young,” he said at last, “but you have the wisdom
of a great <i>marabout</i>.”</p>

<p>He spoke no more, and sat fingering the coral beads from Mecca,
deep in meditation. I sat quiet, too, contemplating the amazing
scene before me. The dark blue and red carpets, the flickering
candles casting grotesque shadows on the ceiling, the flaming
colors of the girls’ dresses as they sat in a semi-circle
contemplating their noble guest, while their bracelets and anklets
gleamed in the dark corners of the room.</p>

<p>Suddenly the old man turned to me again.</p>

<p>“You have a great doctor called Voronoff, have you not?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Well, he does not come from my country, but he is a European,”
I replied.</p>

<p>“I have studied his teaching,” went on the old man. “Can he
really rejuvenate the old?”</p>

<p>“For a short time I believe,” I said, “but I have really not
gone deeply into the question. Personally I do not quite see the
value of being made to live beyond our appointed time.”</p>

<p>The old man smiled.</p>

<p>“You are wise, but you are young. When you feel the weight of
years weighing on you, you will wish again to have all your
vitality, all your faculties. And yet our death is destined, and
what can a human do? <i>Mektoub!</i>”</p>

<p>He bowed his head and seemed again lost in meditation.</p>

<p>“Youth fades rapidly, and old age lasts long,” he said at last.
Then, rising, he moved toward the door.</p>

<p>Outside a warm breeze struck our faces, the stars seemed large
and bright in the dark heavens; over there, down the street, one
could hear the deep notes of the Arab flute drawing out its
plaintive tune, the rhythmical beat of the <i>tam-tam</i> struck
our ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
</p>

<p>“They play a melody of the far south,” he said. “It is very
beautiful, it is very sad. The heart of the Arab dominated is sad.
I will leave you. May Allah bless and keep you young long.
To-morrow we will visit my flocks. <i>Inch Allah</i>.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand, pressed mine, raised his fingers to his
lips and then placed them on his breast. He flung the white burnous
over his shoulder and disappeared into the night.</p>

<p>The note of the flute drifted up with the wind, and I walked
back to the hotel with a feeling of great peace of mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c09"></a>CHAPTER IX<br>
<span class="sc2">THE ARAB CHARACTER</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Before</span> studying a country and its people
it is essential to endeavor to arrive at some conclusion regarding
that people’s character.</p>

<p>All nations have their outstanding characteristics,
characteristics which will always make it so difficult to carry out
the ideals of the Bolshevik or even to make efficacious the worthy
efforts of the League of Nations.</p>

<p>The Briton, adventurous, conservative, law-abiding; the
Frenchman with his horizon and ambitions limited by his home and
his family circle, his thrifty instincts, his sentimental
patriotism; the German, persevering and disciplined, believing only
in himself—give us at once well defined mentalities. The man in the
street knows this, the most advanced idealist can not deny it, so
that the various nations of Europe remain, as hitherto, defined
nations.</p>

<p>It is not possible, however, to say this of the Arab, for though
the words <i>Inch Allah</i>, (If God wills it), is the main
doctrine of the Mohammedan, it is not absolutely Arab. In the first
place, who are the Arabs? A race originating in Arabia is the
obvious and not entirely erroneous reply. But the Arab is more than
this, for since Mohammed appeared and made of his nomad followers a
great force the race has passed through a great many
evolutions.</p>

<p>There is not space in this book to write a long treatise on this
subject, but to those whom this matter<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_65">[65]</span> interests let me recommend the works of
Lothrop Stoddard and Gustave le Bon.</p>

<p>For the moment we are dealing mainly with the character of the
Arab of Algeria, or rather the character of the real Arab of the
South, and not that of the Europeanized waster one meets in the big
centers, or of the effeminate and overcivilized chiefs one sees at
tourist-infested centers such as Biskra and Bou Saada.</p>

<p>With few exceptions those men have lost all their fundamental
principles and are but the apes of a rather poor class of European.
The real Arab of the South belongs to a race to himself, and in
spite of this very definite personality his character is difficult
to study to any satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>Those who have attempted the task will put forward various
reasons for this difficulty, but I am certain that the main
obstacle is the way in which the question is envisaged.</p>

<p>It is out of the question to try to look at this people from any
Western standpoint, utterly impossible because the whole of the
conception of life is different from ours. In Europe and America of
to-day it is the laws which follow the evolution of the people. As
the races become more emancipated, more educated, they require new
laws to suit the new conditions of life. Among the Arabs it is the
reverse.</p>

<p>Mohammed made the laws, laws which were good and which in many
cases remain good, but it must be remembered that they were more
applicable to the days of the Arab splendor than to the daily life
of the Faithful in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>How can one then attempt to look at these people as having any
sort of relationship with us, how can we place ourselves in their
position and look through their eyes? It is impossible.</p>

<p>All that we can do, if bent on this study, is to
live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> among them and
try to understand their reasoning. This I have attempted to do, and
the conclusions I have drawn are set down here for what they may
seem worth.</p>

<p>The Arab is primarily before all the world a man of great calm
and dignity. His dignified walk down the street in his long robes
is typical of his attitude in both private and public life. I have
heard the foolish remark:</p>

<p>“Well, he could not hurry anyway in those cumbersome
clothes!”</p>

<p>Perhaps not, but has an Arab ever been seen to hurry with his
meals, with his prayers, with his ablutions? Does an Arab ever
break into a trot or a canter when riding without some definite
object of winning a race or hunting game? Never. The Arab eats,
prays, washes, rides as slowly as he walks; the humblest shepherd
will look dignified while some millionaire sheep-merchant shouts
and gesticulates over the price of a ewe.</p>

<p>After his dignity we notice his courtesy. An Arab is never rude
deliberately. He may be insincere and say what he thinks will
please, but he will endeavor not to jar on any one’s
sensitiveness.</p>

<p>His temper is quick where honor is concerned, and he will strike
with the knife or shoot with the gun if the matter deserves his
attention.</p>

<p>His hospitality is proverbial. No one coming to his house at the
hour of a meal will be left waiting; rich man or poor man, relative
or infidel, he will be asked to come in to share the repast. There
are many chiefs I know who never sit down less than twelve to
dinner year in, year out, and usually the number is more like
twenty.</p>

<p>Charity and fraternal equality, being the chief principles of
the Koran, are carried out rigorously.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_67">[67]</span> A beggar is never turned away empty handed,
no man is despised because he is poor or not of a great family; at
the same time those men well-born are very proud of their names and
titles, and will tell you at length all about their lineage. One of
the questions the chiefs always ask one when meeting some European
is:</p>

<p>“Is he, or she, of good family?”</p>

<p>Often and again has my friend and partner in sheep-breeding
said, referring to my lonely life in the oasis:</p>

<p>“What you ought to do is to return to England and marry somebody
well-born, somebody we can know.”</p>

<p>The arrogance of it! And yet there is not the slightest tone of
superiority in the statement. It is a foregone conclusion that I
must realize that they could not have some one sharing their
intimacy who was not a lady by birth.</p>

<p>“All that counts is the blood,” is another of their favorite
phrases; “we are all brothers, but it is the great families who
give the example to the less fortunate.”</p>

<p>With this, however, they are very simple in their tastes. It is
true that they enjoy putting on their scarlet burnouses smothered
in decorations for official parties, and that they have a very
extensive wardrobe, but they get tired of their finery in a few
hours and return gladly to their more simple daily dress. Their
life at home is not at all sumptuous. Few sleep in beds,
practically none eat with knives and forks, and the meals, though
sometimes lengthy, are all homely dishes cooked by their
womenfolk.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, laziness is predominant in the Arab. A few
work very hard, but they are in a great minority. The remainder do
nothing which is not necessary for their livelihood, and those who
are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> obliged to earn
their daily bread just earn it and no more. This is partly due to
the climate and partly to the precept of the Koran, which forbids
man to provide for the future as, in so doing, he will lack faith
in the infinite power of God alone.</p>

<p>Sportsmen they all are—loving a gun and a horse more than
anything else in the world, and ready for any form of hunting.</p>

<p>These, roughly, are the good points in their character, and we
must perforce turn to the other side of the picture. To the
uninitiated the calm mask of haughty indifference which
characterizes their faces conceals a great deal of Oriental wisdom.
I do not think this is the case. From an intellectual point of view
the Arab is densely stupid, very ill-read and utterly inartistic.
With an Arab of good upbringing there are two subjects which he can
discuss—religion and sport. If he is interested in business he will
talk about his own particular line but nothing else. They have not
heard of the most world-famed authors. Shakespeare, Goethe,
Voltaire, are not even names to them except when they happen to
have been applied to streets which they have frequented.</p>

<p>Music outside their own is an unknown quantity; pictures other
than photographs of people they know do not exist. All that which
counts for us in the literary, musical, artistic world is as
complete a blank to them as a Babylonian cuneiform to an able
seaman.</p>

<p>It is staggering sometimes to realize their ignorance. Even
those who have been to the French Lycée do not seem to have
absorbed anything beyond reading, writing, arithmetic and a little
geography. And yet they travel abroad. They go to France, some go
to England and Switzerland, and what do they bring back? A
recollection of streets and people and race-meetings and
gaming-tables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
</p>

<p>“<i>Un point, c’est tout!</i>”</p>

<p>I think that the appellation of “Wise Men of the East” as it
applies to Arabs must come from their profound knowledge of the
Koran and its precepts, which in many ways imbues them with
utterances of some depth and of a veiled meaning.</p>

<p>I do not say that they would be better off if they had all our
Northern learning; probably not. I merely set down what is a fact
about the reverse side of the impenetrable mask!</p>

<p>In business the Arab is honest if it is worth while. That is to
say, the poor and uneducated shopman or pedler will cheat as much
as possible, but the well-to-do merchant or landowner will not risk
his name to gain a little more unless he is quite sure of passing
undetected. This, however, applies in some degree to most
races.</p>

<p>The nomads in their sheep deals are usually quite straight.</p>

<p>The Arab has a sense of humor and will tell a good story; he
will lie when required, but it is very rare to find one who will do
so on oath with his hand on the Koran.</p>

<p>One side of the Arab is rather unpleasant, and let it be said at
once that it applies more to those who have come in contact with
Europeans than to others. I refer to their dealings with European
women. Their own are sacred subjects not to be mentioned, whose
names and position are respected, but the European woman, and
chiefly American and English women, do not share the same regard.
This again is greatly due to the foolish attitude of a minority of
Anglo-Saxon women who come to the country and are carried away by
the glamour of the surroundings, by the starlit nights and the
graceful robes of their admirers. If only they could see these men,
as I have sometimes in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_70">[70]</span> Europe, in bowler hats, they would shudder at
the contrast. Now they only see them in their robes under the
African sky and—well, they fall very easily.</p>

<p>The only altercation I have had with my Arab friends has been on
this subject. A common remark one often hears is:</p>

<p>“<i>Oh, les Anglaises!</i>” or “<i>Oh, les Americaines!</i>” and
a knowing wink. French women and Italian have not this reputation,
and what is so lamentable is that through the fact of a few of our
race acting in this way, believing they are far from home and
unnoticed, these morals are attributed to us in general.</p>

<p>There is little else to add about the Arab; some of these
remarks have been elaborated in subsequent chapters, other points
dealing with the superstitious side of the character have been
raised.</p>

<p>One little story to illustrate the childish side of their nature
seems appropriate here:</p>

<p>I was sitting one evening some years ago in the Casino at Biskra
with a <i>caïd</i> friend of mine. As we sat sipping our coffee an
Englishwoman, whom I knew vaguely, came in, and the <i>caïd</i>
pointed her out to me excitedly, asking many questions about her. I
gave him all the information I could, and it then transpired that
he was deeply in love with her, but that as she could not speak any
French their conversation was somewhat limited. He sat for a while
and then, turning, asked me rather diffidently if I would teach him
a few words which would express to the object of his passion all he
felt.</p>

<p>I was rather amused at his anxious tone and laughingly gave him
the following formula:</p>

<p>“I love you.</p>

<p>“Kiss me.</p>

<p>“Forgive me.</p>

<p>“Forget me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
</p>

<p>He repeated it again and again until he had got it quite fixed
in his mind, and then left me, presumably to offer it to the lady.
I did not see my friend again nor the lady, so I do not know how
the courtship, based on my nine words, fared, but one day some
years after this incident I was reading a novel, written also long
after the little English lesson, by an author who could not have
known of the incident; the scene was laid at Biskra; a fictitious
<i>agha</i> was speaking:</p>

<p>. . . “I am learning English,” he said gently; “tell me, please,
if my pronunciation is correct.” And in a curiously indefinable
accent he proceeded to recite the little set piece that some one
had mischievously taught him:</p>

<p>“Love me.</p>

<p>“Kiss me.</p>

<p>“Forgive me.</p>

<p>“Forget me.” . . .<a id="FNanchor_01"></a><a href="#Footnote_01"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The Arab mind had learned nothing more, but he had kept that
sentence fixed in his brain to repeat when the opportunity
presented itself!</p>

<p>They are all children, delightful children who never grow
up.</p>

<p>Twelve hundred years ago they came to Algeria with their customs
and their clothes and their sheep, and they are still in the same
place with the same customs and the same clothes and the same breed
of sheep. And, <i>Inch Allah</i>, they will be there in the same
way when Jesus comes to judge the faithful.</p>

<h2><a id="c10"></a>CHAPTER X<br>
<span class="sc2">LIFE AMONG THE ARABS</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">We must</span> now turn our attention to the
inner life among the Arabs, to their customs, to their religious
observances; and though it is always difficult for a foreigner, and
especially a foreigner in a Mohammedan country, really to see the
life as lived by its people, it is believed that sufficient
intimacy has been developed between the author and the Arabs to
give a very accurate picture of what goes on among them.</p>

<p>The word “Arab” will be used, as it is not intended in this
chapter to touch again on the subject of the pure Berber, mentioned
before; neither is it considered necessary to mention the
Europeanized natives who have adapted themselves to a great extent
to the life of the big commercial towns of the north and who are
all in favor of the Young Turk Movement and the modernizing of the
excellent systems handed down to them by their ancestors.</p>

<p>These pages will be devoted to the average Arab household living
either in the native quarters of the smaller <i>communes
mixtes</i>, in the farms or away in the southern oases and under
the tent in the Sahara.</p>

<p>The first thing which strikes one very forcibly is the
extraordinary respect shown to the head of the family. It is usual
for a great many people of one family to live in the same house,
but it is only the head who counts. Moreover, among the nomads the
<i>caïd</i> of the tribe estimates his people by heads of families.
In the home the father reigns supreme;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_73">[73]</span> he usually has his meals apart or with his
eldest son. In some cases there are three groups of diners, the
chief with the older men and the guests, the sons and their
friends, and the retainers. The food is brought in and placed
before the first group, who eat what they want, then it is passed
to the second group, and finally to the third. After dinner the
older men talk and laugh and smoke, but the younger men will either
sit quiet or, if they want to talk and smoke, they will go outside.
In the presence of the head of the family the younger generation
show the utmost deference; it is unusual for them to sit down when
in conversation with their father, and they never smoke in his
presence.</p>

<p>If a dinner-party is being given and some light or inappropriate
subject of conversation is brought up in the presence of the father
and son, the son will endeavor to change the subject or even leave
the room. Apart they will tell as good a story as any one, but
together it is not considered respectful. Should a chief come into
a café with friends, and a younger member of the family happen to
be there, the latter will leave immediately so as to lay no
restraint on the older man. Many is the time when Europeans,
ignorant of all this etiquette, have asked a party of Arabs to
dinner and have suddenly found that four or five of the party have
not put in an appearance. The host may be hurt, he may be puzzled,
but the solution of the riddle is easy—those four or five guests
have found out that one of the party was a senior man with whom
they could not sit down at table.</p>

<p>In return for all this the head of the family looks after the
whole of the welfare of his descendants, and any relatives are
welcome to eat and reside in his house or tent as long as they
like.</p>

<p>By nature the Arab is very easy-going. Even the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> shopkeepers do not worry people
to buy, and will often tell a customer that the article he requires
is not stocked rather than interrupt a conversation with a friend
over the counter. Their prices are usually rather vague, and
bargaining is quite normal, the result of the deal depending a
great deal on the mood of the shopkeeper. If the deal is not
brought off there is no ill-feeling, and the customer will often be
asked to come in and drink a cup of tea.</p>

<p>The very poor people, and there are a great many, live on
charity and the wages of odd jobs, but it is amazing to see how
body and soul hang together with practically no clothes or
substantial nourishment.</p>

<p>Their occupations and pastimes are varied. They are either
landowners in the northern districts, or sheep-farmers and
date-growers in the south—all very profitable occupations and the
source of great fortunes quite unsuspected by the visitor. In their
leisure they ride and hunt with falcons, and shoot; they enjoy
horse-racing and everything to do with riding, and though a great
many of them have motor-cars they consider them merely as
conveniences, and the greatest ambition of a young Arab is to own a
horse.</p>

<p>As in all Oriental countries, European vices become exaggerated,
and once a native starts gambling or drinking he does little
else.</p>

<p>Otherwise their existence is very simple, and the way they spend
their days is adapted to nature and very healthy. An Arab gets up
early and also quickly. This is due to two reasons. The first is
that he does not usually sleep in a bed, but on a rug on the floor
with another rug over him; the second is that he does not wash on
rising, and he very often goes to sleep in his clothes. How many
times have I been away in out-of-the-way places with Arab friends,
either shooting or attending sheep-markets; coffee has
been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span> ordered for five
<span class="sc2">A. M.</span> They have somehow vaguely wakened me
at four-forty-five, and at four-fifty-five my companions have
appeared, all dressed, to ask why I wasn’t ready! And my reply has
always been the same:</p>

<p>“Because I have a strange and curious habit of undressing when I
go to bed and of shaving when I rise.” And it <i>is</i> considered
a strange and curious habit. But that does not mean that these
Arabs are dirty in their persons—far from it. Before and after
meals they wash their hands and faces, before their prayers they do
the same; sometimes they take a bath. Regularly once a week they go
to the <i>hammam</i>, or steam bath, where there is an unlimited
quantity of hot water, and where they wash from head to foot, and
there is nothing cleaner than washing in a Turkish bath. Moreover,
there are first-rate masseurs who for a moderate fee take pounds of
fat off the patient in an hour.</p>

<p>What I have never been able to discover is how often the average
Arab changes his underclothing. The exterior dress is often sent to
the laundry and I have an idea that in many cases the change is
made four times a year, at the various seasons. Speaking of
clothes, it may perhaps interest the reader to know of what an
Arab’s garments consist:</p>

<p>Next to the skin there is a shirt; there are socks, there are
sometimes drawers, a pair of baggy trousers and leather slippers,
rather like unfinished pumps and not embroidered as may be
supposed. Embroidery on shoes is considered effeminate and can only
be worn on the long red boots used for riding. Over the shirt is
usually a sweater and over that a jacket; it may be a smart
embroidered affair with many buttons, or it may be a simple tunic,
or it may be a European coat, but it does not matter much as it is
entirely covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> by
the <i>gandourah</i>, which is like a long white nightgown with a
low neck, made of wool or silk or cotton.</p>

<p>On the head is a turban which consists of three separate
pieces—the <i>gannoure</i>, which is the high framework made of
felt on which is placed the <i>chech</i>, which entirely covers it,
surrounds the face, covers the neck, and is tucked away inside the
coat. Round the <i>chech</i> is wound either a band of silk or else
the camel’s hair cords, known as <i>khiete</i>. The origin of the
wearing of cords was for the purpose of always having a rope handy
to attach to any receptacle to draw water from the wells in the
Sahara.</p>

<p>Over the whole thing the Arab wears one or two burnouses. These
are long cloaks with a hood and are made of wool, camel’s hair,
silk or cloth. The poor shepherd possesses only a woolen or camel’s
hair cloak, but the well-to-do chief has in addition to his rough
burnous for country wear one made of silk over which he wears one
of blue or green or maroon cloth embroidered with silver or gold.
It is a most convenient garment, as in winter it keeps the wearer
warm and the hood pulled over the turban protects him from rain.
Moreover, when it gets hot one or both burnouses can be removed. At
night they take the place of rugs or blankets.</p>

<p>During the morning the Arab will go about his business either in
the town or out on the plain. If he is at home he will eat a light
lunch at eleven-thirty, but this is not an important meal, and out
on the Sahara he will content himself with a piece of bread and
some milk. Time to an Arab is a very vague convention once he has
got up. At first it exasperates the European who has been brought
up to regular habits, but one realizes little by little that one’s
exasperation is a complete mystery to them, and one gives up
worrying about punctuality. It is very<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_77">[77]</span> annoying sometimes when one has made all
one’s plans to begin a long excursion early in the morning to find
the start fixed for noon, or to invite a lot of men for dinner at
seven-thirty and find some arrive at six-thirty, some at
eight-thirty, and some not at all!</p>

</div>

<p>That is another custom which it takes a long time to understand,
and one is left hurt that people invited do not arrive, and often
do not even make an excuse or consider that one is necessary. It
comes from the fact that in all their houses dinner is always going
for a dozen or so of people, and one more or less does not count.
Every one sits down when the meal is ready, and no one troubles to
count the guests. Of course this does not apply to a regular
invitation to dinner made with the definite purpose of meeting some
one or listening to music; in cases like that no one would dream of
being discourteous. At the same time it is very rare for an Arab
definitely to accept or refuse an invitation. To your request that
he will take a meal with you to-morrow he will reply, <i>“Inch
Allah”</i>—“If God wills it”!</p>

<p>Against this, if you are on friendly terms with the Arabs, you
can arrive about meal time—no surprise will be shown, and you will
squat down and share the meal as if it were your daily habit. In
the same way, if some man came in to see one about six-thirty in
the evening he would expect to be asked to dine, which is often
awkward in a European household.</p>

<p>If the Arab has eaten a midday meal he will probably sleep for
an hour after, and then continue doing what he has to. About
six-thirty comes the dinner, and this meal is important. There is
always the highly spiced soup with pieces of meat floating about,
usually another dish of meat and vegetables, and always the
<i>kous-kous</i>, with more meat. They drink water or milk, for
even those who are in the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_78">[78]</span> habit of taking wine and spirits rarely do so
in their own houses if Europeans are not there. After dinner they
drink their mint tea or coffee, and friends come in to see them, or
they go out themselves and sit in the shops or cafés and drink more
tea, and talk and laugh until it is time to go to bed.</p>

<p>Their meals are eaten on the floor. They keep a kind of narrow
mattress on which they sit, and the dishes are placed on a small
table about a foot high known as a <i>maïda</i>. A common napkin
some eight feet long is placed on their knees all round the circle.
All the food, except the soup and sometimes the <i>kous-kous</i>,
is eaten with the hand, and before the meal and after, soap and
warm water are carried round and every person washes his hands and
face. It is said that these ablutions bring prosperity. There are
usually no glasses, and a common mug is handed round from which
sips are taken.</p>

<p>Of course, when receiving guests of note, or Europeans, the meal
is much more sumptuous, and among the Europeanized chiefs there is
a gaudy dining-room kept for the friends from over the seas.
Crockery of all kinds is produced, knives and forks, a jumble of
wines and a general atmosphere of inconsequent confusion. But the
meal is excellent, though sometimes a trifle long.</p>

<p>This is an average menu for a short dinner:</p>

<ul class="menu">
<li><i>Chorba</i>. Soup with vermicelli, highly spiced.</li>

<li><i>Bourak</i>. Mutton minced with mint and sage, rolled up in a
light pastry—this is a kind of sausage roll.</li>

<li><i>Leham Lalou</i>. A kind of mutton stew in a dark sauce,
cooked with prunes and sweet almonds. The words mean
sweetmeat.</li>

<li><i>Mechoui</i>. The lamb roasted and served whole.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span> Even to Europeans no knives or
forks are issued, and it must be torn to pieces with the
hands.</li>

<li><i>Kous-kous</i>. Looks like semolina and is made of hard wheat
kneaded into tiny round balls and steamed. With it is served a kind
of vegetable soup called <i>marga</i>, a highly spiced sauce, and
often mutton or chicken. There are countless varieties of
<i>kous-kous</i> varying according to localities.</li>

<li><i>Heloua</i>. Sweets and cakes made of flour and honey and
almond paste and orange water.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many other alternative dishes; game often appears, but
as a general rule the <i>chorba</i>, the <i>mechoui</i>, and the
<i>kous-kous</i> are <i>de rigueur</i> for the set dinner. In the
place of the sheep there may occasionally appear a gazelle, and if
an Arab wants to show his deepest respect for you he will serve a
baby camel roasted whole. But this is very rare.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, therefore, the Arab’s life is very simple
and peaceful. He is courteous and hospitable, a rather lazy country
gentleman, not very intelligent, but wiser and more philosophical
than many Europeans on problems of daily life. Men who lay
tremendous stress on points of honor, and who rarely forgive an
injustice or an insult, disliking any sort of encroachment by
non-Mohammedans, they have drifted into inertia behind the precepts
of the Koran.</p>

<p>“What Allah has destined will occur, so why worry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c11"></a>CHAPTER XI<br>
<span class="sc2">ARAB WOMEN</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Having</span> now cast a cursory glance over
the life of the Arab man, let us look into the inner life of the
homestead—that is to say, the life of the women, of the children,
and of the servants. Placing them in the same category does not in
the least suggest that the Arab woman is in any way a slave. Far
from it. This is quite a fallacy, which must be added to the list
of legends to be dispelled in this book.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Kabyles, the women in Algeria have
almost as many rights as the men. They are, of course, not nearly
so free as European women, and they are often obliged to share the
home with other wives, but, as they have been brought up to know no
other mode of living, they do not wish for anything else.</p>

<p>We will take as an example the life of an Arab girl belonging to
a respectable family of moderate means. The daughters of the family
when little girls will help their mother in the household duties,
accompany her when she goes out, learn to cook and to weave and all
the duties of a good housewife. Sometimes they are sent to the
convent of the White Sisters, where they earn a little money and
are taught to make carpets on regular lines. The Sisters will give
them a rudimentary education, but it will only take the form of
lectures on morality and hygiene. It is very, very rare to find an
Arab girl who can read or write. As soon as she reaches a
marriageable age offers will<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_81">[81]</span> be made to her father by the fathers of
eligible young men, and if any union seems opportune terms will be
discussed.</p>

<p>Apart from guaranteeing the bride a home, with enough to live
on, it is usual for the bridegroom’s parents to pay a sum down and
for the bridegroom to give his bride a trousseau, while she in
return will bring a dowry of a few household goods and golden
jewelry—family heirlooms, which may be of great value. When all is
arranged the date of the marriage is fixed, and up to the actual
first contact bride and bridegroom will not see each other. The
young man however often sends his female relatives to inspect the
young woman and to report on her appearance. The wedding lasts for
seven days and is conducted at the girl’s home and at the man’s.
For a week the bride’s mother will entertain all her friends and
the friends of her daughter, while the bridegroom is giving parties
to his companions. After the formality of going to the <i>kadi</i>
the husband has access to the bride. She is brought to his house
and let into a room where he is hiding behind the curtains or under
the bed. When she is alone he suddenly leaps out and seizes her.
This is the first time they meet face to face.</p>

<p>After a quarter of an hour or so an old woman comes in, makes an
examination, and informs the assembled guests that the marriage has
been consummated, and cries of joy are uttered and the newly
married couple separate. It is not until the end of the feast that
the husband and wife live entirely together. Once she is with her
husband she sets about making his home comfortable. If they are
well off she will keep a female servant to do all the rough work
such as sweeping and polishing, but the preparing of the meal is
always done by her. The food is carried by her<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_82">[82]</span> to her husband, and he eats alone. She has
her meals apart or with the other wives.</p>

<p>In the case where a man is already married the new wife, though
she may be the husband’s favorite, will take a secondary place with
the other wives, who will give her all the odd jobs to do. If she
is tactful she will be nice to them, and if she is clever she will
get her husband into her hands and make him dispose of the other
wives. As a matter of fact, this sort of intrigue is getting rare.
In the first place, polygamy is on the decline; this is due partly
to the contact of soldiers with the European method of living
during the war, and partly from reasons of economy. In cases where
the first wife is getting old—and Arab women get old very
quickly—she is often glad to have a young wife as a help.</p>

<p>In the homes of well-to-do Arabs the women are kept under lock
and key, and they practically never go out for a walk. They will be
taken for drives in closed carriages or motors, and occasionally
they will pay visits at nights to their women friends, but they go
heavily veiled and accompanied by many attendants. Once a week they
go to the Turkish bath, and once a week to the cemetery. Sometimes
among the poorer class the women are forced to go out to do their
shopping, but they are veiled from head to foot, and even this is
rare, as the husband usually does the marketing on his way to and
from work.</p>

<p>All this caution, however, does not prevent intrigue and
infidelity, which is facilitated by old women and friends. A visit
to another girl is arranged, the visit is made, but there is
another exit, and the woman goes to see her lover. Unfortunately
this is also becoming common among unmarried girls who escape the
supervision of their parents.</p>

<p>However, in really good families the women are<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> usually straight, and they know,
moreover, how to keep their husbands. In fact, the wife is very
much the mistress in her own home, and she lets her man have just
enough liberty and no more.</p>

<p>The laws of divorce are very broad, and are on an equality for
men and for women. The first case for separation is that of the
couple who, after three days of marriage, go before the <i>kadi</i>
and ask for their release, because they realize that they can’t
stand the sight of each other. In this case they each take back
what they gave and return to their respective homes free, and
shortly marry again.</p>

<p>The other main bases for divorce are the same as in Europe, but
there are also excuses which make things much easier than with us.
For instance, if a woman complains that her husband is out every
night and does not come home till midnight or so, the <i>kadi</i>
will pronounce the necessary decree. In this case the wife keeps
all the man has given her, and he also pays the eleven francs which
is the fee for dissolution of marriage. A man gets his divorce at
once if he finds that his bride is not the <i>pure jeune fille</i>
he supposed her to be. This entails many complications and family
feuds, but, as it is hard to prove, it is usually allowed to go by.
There are cases of divorce after long years of marriage, and there
are cases of the reunion of divorced parties who have lived
separated for long.</p>

<p>The main point to realize is the facility of getting judicially
separated, and the fact that the woman has just as many rights as
the man.</p>

<p>Of course the life the wife leads if she is humble and docile is
not very amusing. In addition to cooking she must weave burnouses
and carpets, either for the home or, if they are poor, for sale,
and the man, having the position of lord and master before the
world, takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
advantage of his wife’s docility if he can. But then this happens
in Europe!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the Arab man is not a bully, and one
notices that whenever he goes to the sheep and cattle markets he
always buys something for his wife, and with his children he is
very kind and thoughtful.</p>

<p>The wives of the nomads lead very much the same life as their
sisters in the towns, the only difference being that they do not
veil themselves when out in the plain.</p>

<p>It is not permitted for a woman to go to the mosque, and it is
unusual for them to say their prayers—in fact, their ignorance of
anything outside the homestead is complete. It is perhaps because
of this that they make good wives and do not hanker after the
supposed joys of the great world.</p>

<p>There is one flaw in all this peaceful life, and that is the
state of widowhood. When the husband dies the woman has nothing,
unless she has been allowed to put money aside herself or has
property of her own. She may be the wife of a <i>marabout</i> or of
an <i>agha</i>—the moment she is a widow she loses all her status.
There are three alternatives open to her. The first is to go on
living with her sons, if they are big enough to keep her; the
second to return to her family or to that of her husband, if they
are alive and willing; or thirdly, to marry again. In well-to-do
families the first two alternatives are the most followed, but the
third is not common, as, though, curiously enough, a man will marry
a divorced girl, he rarely mates himself with a widow.</p>

<p>Of course, if the woman has independent means it is a different
story; but this is rare, and if none of the above openings are
possible her fate is very sad. A lone woman is regarded as having
no position, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> she
must at once make one for herself. Here again she has three further
alternatives: to enter the local <i>zaouia</i>, where she
practically becomes the slave of the <i>marabout</i> and lives the
rest of her life weaving and working in this kind of convent; or,
if she prefers it, she can become a servant; or, as a last
resource, enter the ranks of the dancing-girls in the reserved
quarter. In fact, if she has no occupation and no house of her own,
the French authorities force her to take up her residence in that
special part of the town.</p>

<p>But, except in these particular cases, the Arab woman is not the
bond-slave of the man, and I have no doubt that the majority are
much happier than many European wives. It is, of course, very
difficult to get any definite information about all this, as it is
against the laws of etiquette to mention Arab women to their men.
The above facts have been gathered by little bits of talk here and
there with intimate friends, who have now and then voluntarily
unburdened their hearts, by talks to some of the rare few of the
older generation who have traveled a great deal and who don’t mind
airing their views, and by actual contact with respectable married
women. Of this the less said the better, as such meetings were
strictly against all the laws of propriety, and were contrived by
friendly intrigues.</p>

<p>Secrecy about the womenfolk is so great that the stranger is not
even allowed to hear the sound of their voices, and I have stayed
with an Arab chief for a week, where we were eighteen to dinner
every night, and where there must have been twenty women and as
many children in the same house, and I never heard a sound which
suggested female presence. Even in the Sahara, where the women are
only divided from the men by a rug hung across the center of the
tent, I have passed the night, and only realized that
women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> were present
when a child cried and its mother hushed it.</p>

<p>Some Arab chiefs allow European women to visit their wives, but
it is not very interesting. They can’t speak a word of French, and
they sit staring at the visitor with curious eyes, and touch her
clothes to see how they are woven and put on. Occasionally one
meets with women who have been to Europe, but, with few exceptions,
they regret their ventures and are glad to return.</p>

<p>There is one famous case of an Arab girl who drifted away from
the South, crossed the sea, and eventually found herself in Paris,
where she started dancing. She had an instantaneous success, and in
a short time had visited London and New York, acclaimed wherever
she went. It would be too long to go into all her
adventures—suffice it to say that she was courted by all, that she
met all kinds of interesting people; dressed in the smartest
frocks, and lived on a lavish scale. One day she returned to
Laghouat and she remained six months; during those six months she
lived again as an Arab, then she went back to Paris, but it was too
late. The South had seized her, her people had clutched her heart
again, and she could no longer keep away.</p>

<p>She returned to her home in the oasis. Nothing will now make her
return to Europe, and she says that the only possible life for a
woman is to be married to a nice Arab and shut up. The last time I
saw her she was sitting on the floor of a roughly furnished room,
barefooted, eating <i>kous-kous</i> with her hands out of the same
bowl with her servants!</p>

<h2><a id="c12"></a>CHAPTER XII<br>
<span class="sc2">ARAB LOVE AND THE WOMEN OF THE RESERVED
QUARTER</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">By bracketing</span> these two subjects
together I do not wish it to be supposed that in Algeria the two
are synonymous, though curiously enough there is none of that
sordid atmosphere which is associated with women of easy morals in
Europe. It is generally believed that the Arab man is a brute who
uses women only for his pleasure, and that the Arab woman is a
piece of furniture and accepts the situation. It is another
legend.</p>

<p>There are few men in the world who are such ardent lovers as the
Arabs, and few women who know as well the art of holding a man and
making him dance to her tune. The Arab goes quite mad when he is in
love, and forsakes his home and his people to lead the life of a
lone savage. In the meanwhile the object of his adoration is
laughing at him coldly, without the smallest emotion and without
any encouragement. The lover can continue performing the utmost
follies—the woman won’t flinch if she doesn’t love him.</p>

<p>The moment she does it is quite a different matter. Her love
dominates all, and she becomes the adorer of her man. And yet in
the midst of all this adoration her woman’s instinct never leaves
her, and if she feels that the man is taking her as a habit she
just slips off and leaves him to wonder if he is standing on his
head or on his heels. Many succeed by this method in keeping their
husbands for ever. If a man has a mistress<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_88">[88]</span> she will in no way mix up in his family life,
but at the same time she will be respected by him and by his
friends as if she were his wife, provided she remains shut up.
Generally speaking, however, this is rare, and a man’s mistress
either lives in the reserved quarter or keeps open house at her
lover’s expense. Under these circumstances, though she may have a
few women friends, they are not of the best class, and even the men
who visit her house will only do so under cover of darkness.</p>

<p>The reader will at once ask:</p>

<p>“With polygamy, why is there any necessity for mistresses?”</p>

<p>I suppose it is the spirit of adventure, the desire for
forbidden fruit, which characterizes all intrigues of this kind,
but it is also the attitude of the woman who does not want to bind
herself and prefers her free life until the day she is too old to
enjoy it. Arab women are very capricious, and they love to have the
man dancing attendance on them, bringing them presents, and never
really the master of his own reason.</p>

<p>This atmosphere can only be created in an irregular situation,
for once she is his wife she has certain obligations and his
authority counts. Arab women are more than capricious, they are
heartless as long as they do not love. Certain European women are
too, but never to the extent of the Arabs. They will keep some
infatuated man hanging about them with just the hope of favors for
months, even for years. If they see that he is taking a pull at
himself they will give him just sufficient encouragement to haul
him back, and then drop him again into the depths of despair. And
if the poor chap goes mad or ruins himself it is treated as a
triumph—another conquest.</p>

<p>But once in love the Arab woman is quite a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_89">[89]</span> different being, and her devotion is
without end. I have known a woman who had riches, houses, position,
adulation by men of note, everything a lovely woman could desire,
give up everything she had for a man she loved and live with him in
a state of complete poverty, with just enough but no more. Before
that man came into her life all were fair play to her, and her
moral scruples did not exist. After she had met that man all the
millions in the world would not take her from his side.</p>

<p>Women all the world through are capricious, and swayed by their
whims, and it is by these traits that the skilful ones cause men to
make fools of themselves. The art is dying out in England, and is
on the wane in France, but in Algeria it is at its height, and
sorry is the lot of the unwary one who inadvertently falls in love
with an Arab girl who does not return his love.</p>

<p>Though the same characteristics apply to the women of the
reserved quarter, it is not quite the same thing.</p>

<p>First of all, a few words about this part of the Arab town. It
is, of course, a creation of the French, as it is against all the
laws of the Koran for a man to live with any woman who is not
married to him legally or who is not a recognized concubine. In
fact, it is to avoid this that polygamy was instituted. However,
with the French conquest French civilization had to come too, and
the <i>Quartier</i> was created, primarily for the troops.</p>

<p>It is usually walled in, and entered by a single door which is
guarded by a sentry. Inside there is quite a little city—shops,
cafés, miniature squares, where the dancing takes place in the
summer. The women have their little apartments, where they receive
their friends to drink tea and give little dinner-parties.
It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span> is an atmosphere
of frank gaiety quite impossible to realize without seeing it. Some
of them have their babies with them, others live with their
mothers. The majority of the inmates are of the tribe of the Ouled
Naïl, but there are, of course, many girls from the local tribes
too, the great difference being that those who come from the Ouled
Naïl are not in any way lowering their prestige by living this
life. They have come with the full consent of their parents, and
one day they may leave and honorably marry. It depends a great deal
on the dowry. In the old days the girls always tried to collect
gold pieces, which they strung into necklaces, and one saw a woman
all dressed up and her neck weighed down with hundred-franc and
twenty-franc pieces. Now that gold is no longer current in France
the women convert all the notes they have into bits of gold, which
they have beaten into bracelets and ear-rings and tiaras. Some of
them manage to buy hoarded collections of gold pieces to make into
necklaces, while others have inherited them from their mothers.</p>

<p>However, the main point is to have the dowry in gold actually on
the person, so that there is no danger of its depreciating in
value, and when the girls leave the quarter to go to some private
party in order to dance, they are accompanied by a constable and by
a soldier with a rifle. The result of this system of buying gold
has, of course, made the girls very rich. Paper currency has
depreciated, so that a hundred-franc piece sells for a high price,
and the money, though not fructifying in actual interest, is a
capital ever increasing in value.</p>

<p>Of course these jewels are not common only to the girls of the
Quarter; all Arab women strive to have as much jewelry as possible,
but naturally they have other expenses to consider, whereas a girl
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span> Quarter
invests all she has in jewels, and keeps only a small proportion of
her earnings to buy her frocks.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>The frocks of the Arab women of all classes are the same, and
they are disappointing. In fact, they are almost grotesque, and do
not in the least show off the wearer to her advantage. For daily
use they employ calico or print, tied round the waist with a
ribbon, while on the head there is a colored scarf. When they are
all dressed up for a party their outer garment is of silk or of
taffeta, sometimes of velvet, sewed about with ribbons and
embroidery, and of all shades of brilliant colors. The hair is long
and smeared in unguents, and plaited round the head, about which
they wear two scarfs bound one above the other, also of very
striking hues. Those who have golden tiaras fix them in front of
the scarf head-dress, with golden chains hanging down from the
sides, passing under the chin and up the other side. Round the neck
are the necklaces of gold pieces, in the center of the breast a
round golden brooch, and about the waist a silver or golden belt.
Their arms are covered with bracelets, which are rarely beautiful
because they are too heavy; the same applies to the anklets. What
strikes one first as a jarring contrast are the feet.</p>

<p>In the first place, Arab women’s ankles are rather thick, but,
instead of wearing attractive Arab slippers associated with the
illustrations of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, they buy themselves
cheap French shoes and encase their fat legs in cotton or woolen
stockings, which have no connection at all with the color-scheme of
the dress. They also spoil their figures by wearing layers of
coarse underclothing. A group of Arab girls a few yards away, about
to dance, is a picturesque spectacle, but their individual
appearance in those gaudy clothes is not attractive. And yet some
of the girls when young are lovely, their big black eyes
especially, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> their
mouths full of fun and inconsequent gaiety. With the exception of
the hair they keep themselves clean, and they attend the Turkish
bath regularly.</p>

<p>It is most amusing to stroll into the cafés of the Quarter at
night and sit down on one of the benches among the Arabs under the
flickering light of the oil-lamp or the hiss of the acetylene, and
watch the girls in their semi-party dresses dancing slowly up and
down the center. The <i>raïta</i> squeals and the <i>tam-tam</i>
beats in regular cadence while the dance proceeds.</p>

<p>There are all kinds of different steps and figures, and though
the <i>danse du ventre</i>, which is a hideous muscular distortion
of the abdomen, is always carried through, there are many other
dances which are pleasing to the eye, and the movements of the
hands remind one of the wings of a butterfly. Moreover, simple as
these dances may seem, there is a tremendous amount of technique
about them, and the poise of the body, and the movements of the
feet, quite apart from the hands, take long years to learn. A
little girl will begin her apprenticeship at the age of twelve, and
at seventeen she will be proficient. Some of the dancers become
famous, and are as well known among the Arabs as European
stars.</p>

<p>There are also some Arab women who sing and play the mandolin.
Their voices are, on the whole, rather harsh, except in the sad
ballads of the South, which drone out into the plaintive notes so
hard to copy.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of the gramophone into Arab life the
girls who are known to be appreciated are paid large sums to make
records, and the result is deplorable, as the harshness of the
voice is only accentuated by the needle.</p>

<p>The saddest part about Arab women is the rapidity with which
they grow old, or, rather, mature. They<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_93">[93]</span> attain the status of womanhood between the
ages of twelve and fourteen, and between fifteen and twenty they
are at their best. After that they suddenly seem to fade, and all
at once look near to thirty-five. But there it stops, and they
don’t get any older for ten or fifteen years; then another sudden
leap forward and a woman of fifty is a wrinkled old lady.</p>

<p>Such is the Arab woman of to-day, and such she will remain until
civilization finds its way in and destroys all the good traditions
of the past. The task will be a hard one, but the action of
Mustapha Kemal in Turkey, though it has probably shocked the Arabs,
has given them much to think about. However, for the time being the
life goes on as it has done for the past twelve hundred years, and
long may it do so.</p>

<h2><a id="c13"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br>
<span class="sc2">ARAB MUSIC AND DANCING</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> talked a great deal about music
and dancing in Algeria without describing their characteristics.
There are three very distinct classes of music: that for dancing,
that for ballads about war or love, and that for religious
chants.</p>

<p>These various forms of music have their respective instruments,
which, though few in number, differ considerably one from the
other. The first is the <i>raïta</i>: in shape it resembles a short
trumpet bored with holes, on which rest the fingers, and with a
bell-shaped mouth. The sound is created by vast quantities of air
being blown through a reed mouthpiece, producing a sound not unlike
the bagpipes, only much louder. In fact, I have rarely heard one
man produce such an ear-piercing and strident squeal as the
<i>raïta</i>-player, and sitting close up to the music is pain and
grief. This instrument is used exclusively for dancing, and it is
accompanied by a man with a <i>tam-tam</i> or a
<i>derbouca</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>tam-tam</i> resembles in shape a very large tambourine,
and is played with both hands, producing a rather dry, rhythmical
cadence. The <i>derbouca</i> looks like a large flower-vase with a
round body and a long neck. Over the farther end is stretched a
piece of skin, and the playing is the same as the <i>tam-tam</i>,
but with a much deeper sound.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, one often sees a tambourinist; but the
usual orchestra for dancing consists<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_95">[95]</span> of two men—the <i>raïta</i>-player and the
drummer, with his <i>tam-tam</i> or <i>derbouca</i>.</p>

<p>The second type of wind instrument is the flute. This is either
the ordinary penny whistle made out of a reed and producing the
same sort of music, only softer, or the long flute, chiefly found
in the southern areas. The flute is the most interesting of all the
Arab instruments and the hardest to play. It consists of a long
reed hollowed out, about half an inch in diameter and from two to
three feet long. It has eight stops, but there is no sort of
mouthpiece.</p>

<p>The sound is produced by the player blowing across the top of
the flute at some particular angle which I have never been able to
discover, and producing the softest, saddest, deepest note one can
possibly imagine.</p>

<p>To the most unmusical the sound of the long flute must appeal,
and when accompanying one of those love ballads of the far South it
is enchanting.</p>

<p>These two flutes are used to accompany all kinds of songs, but
chiefly those concerning the exploits of heroes and the love lays
which hold such a big place in all Arab melodies. Occasionally it
is used to follow religious chants, but not always.</p>

<p>The flute is usually accompanied by the <i>tam-tam</i> or the
<i>derbouca</i>, which is played very softly. Moreover, the
accompaniment to the song is more often only heard between each
verse, while during the singing it is just a faint drone with a
distinct time-beating, and sometimes no music at all.</p>

<p>The religious chants, which are not, as might be supposed, sung
in the mosques but at the shrines of saints or in private houses,
have usually no accompaniment except the <i>tam-tam</i>. These
chants consist of either hymns in praise of some saint or
<i>marabout</i>, or else in long passages of the Koran telling one
of our well-known Bible stories. At first sight it would
seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> that such music
without any sort of instrument would be singularly dull, but when
one hears the singer bending over his <i>tam-tam</i>, pouring out a
volume of sound, keeping a wonderful time with his hands, one is
carried away by the rhythm.</p>

<p>At the end of each verse or group of verses there is usually a
chorus in praise of Allah or of Mohammed, which is taken up by the
audience.</p>

<p>The performers in the cases of the dance-music and the
ballad-singing are professionals who either earn their living by
playing nightly in the local cafés or by wandering about the
country earning their supper as they go. Some of them are poets,
and will extemporize songs about the host or about his
mistress.</p>

<p>There are also mandolinists and violinists, but these are
usually found among private individuals who perform for their own
amusement or for that of their friends. They play the same sort of
music, both religious and otherwise, and if one has a friend who
owns a mandolin a very pleasant evening may be passed with
delightful music. It is much gayer, and there are some airs which
could almost be used for modern dancing.</p>

<p>The violinists are disappointing from the European standpoint.
The player does not place the instrument to his shoulder, but holds
it upright on his knee and draws the bow across the strings rather
after the fashion of a man with a double bass, emitting a somewhat
corresponding sound.</p>

<p>At first Arab music seems all the same, and the unaccustomed
listener can not differentiate between the melodies, but little by
little the ear becoming accustomed, he can tell at once if the air
is from Oran or from Algiers, from the mountains of the Tell or
from the far South; and the beat of the religious chant is
unmistakable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
</p>

<p>There are occasionally companies of musicians who travel around
with a variety of instruments and singers, male and female, and
dancers. There are also those who sing only the Koran, and serious
<i>marabouts</i> almost always have their private musicians. One
also sees troupes of actors, usually Tunisians, who give small
plays interspersed with music and dancing. The performance goes on
for hours and hours, and the audience sits spellbound without
uttering a sound of approval or disapproval. Occasionally a comic
scene provokes laughter, but generally speaking a dramatic
performance is carried through in absolute silence.</p>

<p>The dancing is as varied as the music. It is usually carried out
by women, who start learning at a very youthful age. The <i>danse
du ventre</i>, which is essentially of the North, or of Turkish
origin, is decidedly ugly. It is, however, much appreciated and
takes endless practise to learn.</p>

<p>The dance of the Ouled Naïls, on which is based most of the
other dances, is very picturesque, and the movements of the hands,
like the wings of a hunting hawk, and the feet, are a delight to
watch.</p>

<p>Occasionally men dance too; sometimes in the cafés with a woman
executing strange figures, but usually alone or with other men. One
of the finest exhibitions of this kind I ever saw was at Ghardaia
one warm evening in April.</p>

<p>A great fire of alfa grass had been lighted in the market-square
illuminating the unsymmetrical arches; masses of men in white
squatted all round, while above, on the flat roofs of the houses,
could be discerned rows and rows of veiled women peering down on
the scene below like ghostly gargoyles. The music was the
<i>raïta</i> and the <i>tam-tam</i>, and even in the open air the
volume of sound produced by the musicians was sufficient to fill
the whole square.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
</p>

<p>Suddenly a dozen or so men rose, formed themselves into two
lines facing one another, and then majestically, with slow steps,
they advanced toward each other; when they met they hesitated and
then retreated. It was like the opening of a quadrille. At first it
was all very solemn, and the figures consisted mostly of slow
rhythmical steps, then as the music inspired them, their bodies
seemed to stiffen and their feet to move more rapidly. Suddenly and
simultaneously, as the <i>raïta</i> broke into a wilder air, the
two groups stopped for a second and then, raising their arms,
brandished their sticks in the air.</p>

<p>Again they advanced, but this time much more quickly, and as
they met struck the sticks of the opposing group; back they
retreated to the original post, again they advanced, and, passing
through the other group, took up a place at the other end of the
square. The fire blazed up and lit up the faces shining in the
flickering light as they looked forward with bright, excited
eyes.</p>

<p>A group of men detached themselves and started dancing alone;
they moved slowly round the group of spectators, then as the music
rose they went faster and faster until they were spinning in a mad
whirl round the fire. Faster, faster, faster, until, with a gasp, a
dancer fell in a state of exhaustion and another took his
place.</p>

<p>And so the dancing went on; the few Europeans who were present
gradually slipped away, but long after I was in bed I could hear
away in the distance the skirl of the <i>raïta</i>, and I could
imagine those wild men whirling madly round and round the
market-square.</p>

<p>Another form of music and dancing seen in Algeria, but much less
common than that which I have described above, is that carried out
by negroes. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> fact
that a man is black does not confer any lowering mark on him in
Algeria. He is not the common coarse nigger, but of the Senegalese
and Sudanese type, and probably a blood descendant of the Numidians
who ruled parts of the country before the Arab invasions.</p>

<p>The dances these men, and sometimes the women, perform are
remarkable chiefly for the fact that the dancers and the orchestra
are one and the same thing. Six or eight persons will get up, among
whom one carries a drum and others two or three heavy cymbals and
an instrument like an enormous iron castanet. The dancers form a
compact circle and begin slowly chanting, accompanying their voices
with the drum and the cymbals. Then gradually the voices rise, and
with them the clashing of the instruments, until the whole develops
into a wild war-song which increases in speed at every bar. The
black men dance round and round, first on one foot and then on the
other, perspiration pouring off their dark foreheads, their eyes
starting out of their heads; nothing stops them; in fact, once they
begin it is impossible to quell the dance until exhaustion has done
its work.</p>

<p>I remember once going to a party at a private house where eight
of these dancers, six men and two women, had come to perform. They
started, and it was a wonderful sight to see them gyrating round
the pillared court, with the setting of Arabs all round and the
stars shining down from above. But after an hour or so of this, the
audience got rather bored, and an attempt was made to get them to
stop; this was, however, impossible, and on, on they went. Finally
the host got angry, and with difficulty the performers were pushed
into the street, still dancing and quite oblivious of all about
them.</p>

<p>Our party continued, and some hours later, when I was walking
home, I suddenly came upon the negroes<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_100">[100]</span> still dancing. It is true that only a few
remained, but these went on and on with their terrible chant, and
on and on they whirled, unable to stop, unable to think, until
their bodies gave out and they fell upon the ground.</p>

<p>Yes, dancing and music in Algeria is varied, and its charm,
though an acquired taste, is something quite unlike anything else,
and takes hold of the senses in a most extraordinary way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c14"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br>
<span class="sc2">RELIGION</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">With</span> sudden contrast, we turn our
attention to the most important problem in the daily life of the
Arab— religion. Now, it is a curious thing that in practically all
European countries religion has not much sway over the general
masses, and that frequently it is subject-matter for controversy
and discord. Even among those members of the community who are
still faithful believers, the church is not really interwoven in
the hum of daily life. Not so in Algeria. Every Arab who has not
been degenerated by Europe into atheism— and it must be admitted
that there are very few of these—believes in Allah, believes in
Mohammed, in the world to come, with eternal damnation or
salvation. But not only does he believe it to the extent of
practising the religion in the mosque as European believers do in
the church, but he continues following the precepts of the Faith in
every moment of his life.</p>

<p>After living a while with the Arabs it comes as a revelation
quite unexpected, and it makes one wonder whether Mohammed,
thirteen hundred years ago, had any idea what effect his preaching
would have on his followers; probably not. He always strikes one as
a man who was almost forced into the path which he followed by
circumstances about him. However, these pages are not the place to
raise this question. What is certain is the immense change which
swept over North Africa when the Arab invasions began in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> seventh
century, bringing with them all the doctrines of the new faith into
a land full of rival beliefs.</p>

<p>There is less difference in Algeria between that period and the
present than there was between the sixth century and the days of
Carthage in all its splendor, and whether we are discussing the
Arabs of the north or of the Sahara, or whether the Berbers of the
Kabyle Mountains or those of the Mzab, there is one expression
which covers them all:</p>

<p>“They are Mohammedans.”</p>

<p>Not all Mohammedans are of the same denomination, but they are
much less divided than the different sects in England, and all with
the same fervent belief:</p>

<p class="quote"><i>La ilahah ill Allah, Mohammed Rasoul Allah.</i>
</p>

<p class="nind">There is no God but God, and Mohammed is his
prophet.</p>

<p>Mohammedanism is, moreover, in itself a complete solution to all
the problems of life, both temporal and spiritual. It is not only a
teaching of religious principles, but also the framework of all
social laws, and a person who follows its precepts will have not
only a clean soul, but also a clean body.</p>

<p>The ablutions, the forbidden meats and wines, the many postures
taken during the prayer five times a day, were all invented with a
purpose. The Arab was dirty by nature; he was told to wash before
saying his prayers; in cases where water lacked, to clean himself
with sand. It was known that pork was bad for people living in hot
countries; it was forbidden. The laziness of the Oriental is
proverbial; physical exercises were devised for him in his daily
prayers before Mr. Sandow and his disciples thought of the
present-day training.</p>

<p>He was told not to frequent women of easy morals;<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span> knowing his nature, the task
was made less difficult by allowing him more than one wife, while
at the same time, realizing the inconsistency of human nature, laws
were provided which enabled him to free himself easily from the
bonds of marriage if he felt that it was necessary.</p>

<p>To make him rise early in the morning the first hour of prayer
was ordained before sunrise; in the middle of the day there are
prayers, which prevent a too-long siesta. Realizing that women in
religion are the cause of much trouble, they were excluded from the
mosque and from anything to do with its rites. Furthermore,
remembering that two great religions had passed before, there could
be no question of ignoring them. One therefore finds practically
the whole of the Old Testament in the Koran, as well as the coming
of Jesus (Aïssa). Here the belief stops and states that God
substituted another man for the Christ to be crucified, while Jesus
went straight up to heaven like Elijah. The Koran further states
that Jesus will come again at the day of judgment, but that
Mohammed will not.</p>

<p>These doctrines completed what Judaism and Christianity had
begun, and made them stronger by the precept of “Equality of all
men in the fold and fierce hatred for all outside it.”</p>

<p>Talking casually to Arabs, it is hard to realize this hatred,
but it is there at all times. We are not merely Englishmen, or
Frenchmen, or Italians—we are infidels, we are unbelievers, we are
not chosen to go to Paradise. We shall not sit by the river under
the shade of the trees and be fed on delicious meat and drink
wonderful wines which do not intoxicate, while women go about
unveiled and we are married spiritually to those we love.</p>

<p>That is the great barrier between Mohammedans<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span> and all other creeds, and,
being one of the great principles of the religion, is
unsurmountable. The reward, the great reward of the Faithful is
paradise— for all others it is hell.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the picture drawn of the life to come for a
good Arab is very attractive, much more so than our rather vague
golden city we read of. All that has been forbidden on earth will
be permitted above, and the faith in this is absolute.</p>

<p>The number of Arabs who do not follow all the principles of the
religion is few. Even those who drink wine when guests are present
rarely do so when alone, while those who do carry it to excess are
usually very low characters. The origin of the interdiction of
intoxicants is said to be because once at Mecca the <i>imam</i>
leading the prayer was drunk and he went through the ceremony all
wrong, with the result that all the followers did the same as he
did. Hence a sacrilege owing to wine-drinking, hence the forbidding
of its use among the Faithful. As evidence of the evil caused by
drinking the following story is told with much solemnity.</p>

<p>A Mohammedan was once caught by two unscrupulous scoundrels who
said they would kill him unless he agreed to do one of three
things: drink a bottle of wine, rob his father, or murder the
<i>marabout</i>. The poor man chose what he thought was the least
of these evils and drank the bottle of wine, with the result that
he also robbed his father and killed the <i>marabout</i>!</p>

<p>Prayers are said either collectively in the mosque before
sunrise, at noon, at three, at sunset, and at eight at night, when
the <i>muezzin</i> comes out and calls the Faithful in that
high-pitched voice which is almost a chant, or else they are said
individually. If they are said in the mosque they are led by the
<i>imam</i>, who afterwards reads the Koran, and sometimes a
kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span> of sermon
based on the Holy Book is given by the <i>mufti</i>.</p>

<p>The individual prayer can be said anywhere—in the house, on the
roof, in the street. It is done without any sort of
self-consciousness or ostentation. The man just turns away from his
daily task, faces Mecca, and goes through all the forms of prayer.
It is extraordinary to take an Arab on a starless night in the
desert and see him always turn instinctively to the East. At first
it is a little disconcerting for a European suddenly to see a
member of the party get up and start this performance; he feels
that there ought to be some awkward silence; but not at all—the
chatter goes on and the prayer returns and continues talking as if
he had never left his place.</p>

<p>Some people maintain that many Arabs say their prayers publicly
just in the same way as did the Pharisees of the Old Testament, and
that if they had to commune with God in private they would not do
so. I consider this quite a fallacy, and from the age of fifteen,
when a boy is supposed to know the Koran and therefore be able to
learn his prayers, they pray before the world without the smallest
thought of who is looking and who is not. The actual prayer is a
fixed formula, and when it is over the supplicant turns his head
first to the right and then to the left saying “The blessing of God
and His mercy be on thee.” These words are addressed to the two
guardian angels who accompany all Mohammedans on earth, the angel
on the right noting all good actions, the angel on the left
recording all the bad.</p>

<p>After the prayer, which refers only to the greatness and
goodness of God, private blessings may be asked for, but it is not
usual to bring temporal matters into this private communion with
the Almighty. If the supplicant is to be recompensed on this earth
it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> not necessary
to remind God of what He has already ordained.</p>

<p>What seems so simple and right in this religion is the absence
of any sort of intermediary in the shape of priest or minister. The
good Mohammedan can observe the whole of his religion from the age
of fifteen until he dies without ever setting foot inside a mosque
or speaking to an <i>imam</i>. The mosques are all very simple
indeed, with very little decoration, as pictures and statues are
forbidden.</p>

<p>The pilgrim who has been to Mecca and Medina is much respected,
and has the prefix <i>hadj</i> (pilgrim) attached to his name.
Yearly ships from Algiers transport bands of Arabs who have saved
up to do this journey. There have been cases of men who have walked
all the way across Tripoli and Egypt to perform the rites at the
Kaaba and to see the tomb of the Prophet.</p>

<p>It would take too long in this book to go into the various
divisions or sects which have created themselves in the Mohammedan
religion, as in all other faiths. It will suffice to mention some
of the main groups:</p>

<p>The Sunnites are orthodox;</p>

<p>The Shiahs, followers of Ali;</p>

<p>The Ibadites, followers of Abd Allah ben Ibad;</p>

<p>The Sofrites, followers of Abd Allah ben Sofar;</p>

<p>The Kharedjites are dissenters.</p>

<p>It was this last form of religion which the Berbers accepted and
which is practised to this day in all their centers in Algeria.
These groups are divided and subdivided into some seventy sects
which it would require years of study to examine, and, unless one
is a specialist in this matter, are of little interest to the
average traveler.</p>

<p>What is interesting, however, is to read a well<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span> translated edition of the
Koran, with a short life of Mohammed. This will give more insight
into the religious side of Arab life than endless treatises on the
matter. And it would be a good thing if more of our soldiers who
come into contact with the Moslems all over the British Empire were
more acquainted with these details.</p>

<p>At first the French did not grasp the significance of Islam in
their North African territories; now that they have, they use it to
advantage, and they give absolute liberty on these questions to
their subjects. Even the orders of the White Fathers and the White
Sisters do nothing to try to convert the Arab. They realize the
little good it would do and the general hostility it would create.
They therefore set a good example, teach the boys and girls how to
work and lead a clean life, and, if one or two lean toward
Christianity, they help them; but it is rare, very rare to find
converts.</p>

<p>The Arab dislikes domination, but he realizes the advantages
brought by a civilized race who give him roads, laws, railways,
commerce; yet he will not tolerate his private life or religion
being encroached upon, and if this liberty is granted him he will
accept all the rest.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are missionaries, I hastily add well-meaning
missionaries, chiefly from England, who have settled in North
Africa, as they have in other Moslem countries, in order to convert
the natives. They are too few to do any real harm, but they are
wasting their time and their money on people who consider that
their own religion is far superior to any other and who see no
necessity to change it—a religion which preaches charity and which
carries it out, for it is by the rich that the poor live.</p>

<p>“After all,” said an Arab chief one day, “our<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span> religion is six hundred years
younger than yours, and therefore based on later experience, but,
even if it wasn’t, what would you say if a band of Arabs, chiefly
women, landed in England and tried to interfere with your
faith?”</p>

<p>There is no answer. It is folly of the well meaning, who would
do better to turn their attention to their own people, who as a
whole do not believe, or, at any rate, do not practise their
beliefs in the same conscientious manner as do the followers of
Mohammed in Algeria.</p>

<h2><a id="c15"></a>CHAPTER XV<br>
<span class="sc2">RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Apart</span> from the daily prayers there are
various feasts which are celebrated regularly by all good
Mohammedans. They do not come at regular dates as, owing to the
fact that the Moslem year is lunar, all the months begin ten days
earlier each year.</p>

<p>In order of rotation these feasts are as follows: Race el Ame,
new year; Aschana, the tenth day of the first month, sometimes
known as the Feast of Moses; those who observe it are promised ten
times of all they have; Makante, or Mouloud, the birth of Mohammed;
Aïd Serrir, which is celebrated at the end of Ramadan or Mohammedan
Lent, and the Aïd el Kebir. The most important are the Aïd Serrir,
or Lesser Feast, in opposition to Aïd el Kebir, the Greater Feast
or Feast of the Sheep. As a matter of fact the Aïd Serrir causes
more rejoicing and lasts three days, probably because it succeeds
the Ramadan.</p>

<p>The austerity of this Ramadan fast has given cause to much
controversy; it is not for us to discuss its merits, but until one
has seen the people actually observing the rites it is difficult to
realize how strictly they are kept. The Ramadan starts the day
after the <i>mufti</i> or <i>kadi</i> in some definite center has
seen the new moon of the season with the naked eye, or, in the
event of a cloudy evening, on the report of some trustworthy person
in some other place. Far away in the South the local <i>muftis</i>
or <i>kadis</i> are permitted to judge<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_110">[110]</span> the moment for themselves, but generally
speaking the fast starts at the same time all over Algeria.</p>

<p>It ends as soon as the next new moon is visible, and sometimes,
owing to bad weather, the inhabitants of a town may fast one or two
days longer than people who live where the night has been clear.
From the moment the decree is sent abroad that the Ramadan has
begun all believers must observe the fast for thirty consecutive
days. During this period they must neither eat nor drink nor smoke
from two hours before the dawn until after sunset.</p>

<p>The time-table on the opposite page published for the Ramadan of
1926, which took place in April, gives some idea of the length of
time passed without nourishment or water:</p>

<p>The decisive moment of the evening is that at which the
<i>imam</i> can no longer distinguish a white hair from a black,
held at arm’s length. A gun is then fired, cries of joy rise from
the populace, and the first meal is hungrily attacked. Those who
are out on the plain pull out a few dates which they munch until
they get home. From the firing of the gun they can eat and drink as
much water or milk as they like until two hours before dawn. As a
general rule they begin with a big dinner. Then they rest, after
which they go out and visit their friends or walk about the streets
till midnight, when they return home and have a second big meal
followed by bed. At first sight this penitence may not seem
rigorous. Perhaps not for those rich men who can convert the night
into the day; but to the average worker it is a terrible
ordeal.</p>

<p>Fifteen hours or so with nothing to eat and nothing to drink!
This last privation is especially trying when the Ramadan falls in
the summer months and when consequently the period of fasting is
longer.</p>

<p>What is most astonishing is to see how strictly<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> the rules are observed, and
even those who in ordinary times take wines and spirits are not
only completely sober for thirty days, but do not touch any
intoxicant for some weeks before the fast begins. Some men suffer
physically a good deal and their faces become pinched; others who
are heavy smokers develop jumpy nerves. Almost all become bad
tempered and easily offended and they work as little as possible,
their only incentive to do anything being the necessity to have
liquid cash to purchase their new clothes for the feast of the last
day. Even this does not rouse them much,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_112">[112]</span> and they usually end by selling some of
their household goods or their wives’ jewels to supply the
necessary funds. It is a great time for the Jews and rich Arab
merchants, who buy up all they can at low prices to resell to the
tourists.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw7">
<figure class="iw7" id="i18"><img src='images/i18.jpg' alt=''>
</figure>
</div>

<p>If by any chance the fast is not observed according to letter it
does not count, and it must be caught up after the Ramadan. For
instance, during this period a man may not touch his wife; if he
sees a woman and she creates in his mind any sort of emotion, it is
sufficient for the day’s fast to be considered as unaccomplished.
If he touches the palm of a woman’s hand, he can not go to the
mosque until he has washed all over. All is a matter of conscience,
and it would be quite easy for any one to retire to the privacy of
his room and eat a piece of bread or drink some water; no one would
be any the wiser, but it is a certain fact that it is not done.
Those few who do not observe the fast are thoroughly despised.</p>

<p>When the next new moon has been observed a final gun is fired
and the people rise early in the morning dressed in their new
clothes to go to the mosque. The Grande Prière takes place in all
its solemnity, and for an hour robed figures bow and prostrate
themselves in regular cadence. When it is over every one streams
into the street and hand in hand marches leisurely up and down the
main ways. As friends or relations meet the brotherly kiss is
exchanged; jokes are passed and gaiety reigns supreme.</p>

<p>The girls from the Quarter come out in all the gaudiness of
their multi-colored clothes; their jewels glint in the sunlight
contrasting with the white burnouses of the men.</p>

<p>At eleven the <i>muezzin</i> calls to prayer from the minaret;
the more conscientious return to the mosque before the first midday
meal since the Ramadan moon.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
<p>The poorest household has scraped together enough to have
something extra to eat, and among the rich the meal is
interminable. In the afternoon every one is out again wandering
hand in hand through gardens and alleys, or sitting under the palm
trees chatting and smoking—chiefly smoking. Toward dusk the city
takes on another aspect. In the reserved quarter the streets are
thronged with soldiers and nomads; the strident skirl of the
<i>raïta</i> with the beat of the <i>tam-tam</i>, and the dances,
which have practically ceased during the fast, rebegin. It is a gay
spectacle, and it makes one realize the joys of forbidden
fruits.</p>

<p>In the European quarter too the younger renegades are flocking,
consuming excessive quantities of forbidden wine and beer. As the
night draws on, voices are raised, some in laughter, some in song,
others in anger, and it is rare for the feast to pass without
several nasty knife wounds, while broken heads are numerous. After
all, the fast has lasted long enough, the Ramadan must be
celebrated, and he who can not contain his emotions must suffer the
quick flash of the dagger or the clenched fist of the followers of
the Prophet liberated from the fast.</p>

<p>The Aïd el Kebir, which is the great feast of the year, falls
two months later. On this day every one who can afford it is
supposed to kill a sheep and divide it among the family. Those who
are very rich kill several sheep and give them to those who can not
afford it. The belief is that when the soul goes to enter paradise
it will have to follow a narrow path which consists of a razor-like
blade. The soul whose mortal self has killed many sheep will be met
by the slaughtered ones, who apparently have no thought of
reprisals, and will be carried across the knives. The gratitude of
the sheep seems a little unexpected.</p>

<p>The other feasts, such as the Birth of the Prophet,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span> New Year’s Day, the Aschana,
are not observed with any great feasting. Candles are lit in the
mosques, the Grande Prière is said collectively, and a little more
food than usual is eaten.</p>

<p>Quite apart from the orthodox or dissenting religious
observances associated with the mosque, there are other rites,
which are really private affairs, observed by independent groups of
men who venerate some particular saint. They are really little
clubs, and though all its members are strict Mohammedans belonging
to one of the sects, believing in all the prophets, they are very
proud of the particular saint whom they venerate.</p>

<p>There are the followers of Sidi Abd-el-Kader, the great
<i>marabout</i>, second only to the Prophet; of Sidi-el-Hadj-Aïssa,
who founded Laghouat; of Sidi Abd er Rahmane, patron of Algiers,
and many others. Twice a week these members of the clubs meet,
either in the private mosque dedicated to the <i>marabout</i>, or,
if it is fine, before the edifice erected in his name out-of-doors.
Here they drink tea, which is either provided by themselves or is
often sent by people of the town who wish to find grace in the eyes
of the saint.</p>

<p>The men sit round in a circle and sing religious songs in unison
while the time is kept by a man with a tambourine. On a clear
moonlight night it is a most impressive sight to see the earnest
faces of the singers as they sit rigidly intoning the long verses
of the chant, which is repeated in a chorus, rising finally into a
wild rhythm until it stops suddenly and unexpectedly. Visitors are
rare on these evenings, and they sit apart with their shoes off;
women occasionally come, but they are heavily veiled and are hidden
away in a corner.</p>

<p>The actual tombs of <i>marabouts</i> are much venerated, as are
also the little domes erected at places<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_115">[115]</span> where some holy man has rested; candles are
lit and offerings made in their names. Though actual sacrificing of
beasts does not take place in the way in which we associate it in
the Old Testament, there are many who vow that if they are granted
some favor they will kill a sheep in the name of the
<i>marabout</i> invoked. When the sheep is killed it is cooked and
eaten by the supplicant and by any poor friends who like to come
in. Occasionally a bullock is slaughtered to bring rain.</p>

<p>There are other beliefs which would be considered by Europeans
to be mere superstitions, but they so form part of the religion
that practically every one admits them,—the power of spells, the
evil eye, the charms against disease. A woman with a headache will
wear a piece of paper with words written by a <i>marabout</i> upon
it, and believe that it will remove the pain. In fact, into all the
daily life religion is woven until it becomes part of the people’s
existence, and from the prayer said in public to the abstinence
from wine one can not keep away from it. Its simplicity, its
absence of all unnecessary intermediaries in communion with the
Almighty, make it very easy to follow. Its laws which, with all
their sternness, are yet adapted to the frailty of mankind, seem to
give one an assurance of its sincerity. Its recognition of all the
prophets we know of gives it a feeling of broad-mindedness, and the
picture of its future is easy to grasp.</p>

<p>There is one God and He is alone. God is all-powerful. “What He
has destined will take place,” and in their belief of the
<i>mektoub</i> the secret of the Arabs’ peace of mind is found.
Nothing can alter fate. And if things go wrong it is no good
saying, “If I had done this, or done that, I should have avoided
this.” No; “Allah willed it, and the puny human can do nothing
against <i>mektoub</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c16"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br>
<span class="sc2">“MEKTOUB” AND OTHER SUPERSTITIONS</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Having</span> now seen the principles of the
faith as set out by the Koran, we must turn our attention to the
more superstitious side, which, as in all faiths, has grown up with
the course of time.</p>

<p>As stated before, the first great fundamental point which
dominates the whole of Islam and makes it unlike other beliefs is
summed up in that word <i>mektoub</i>—“It is written.” Generally
speaking, every Mohammedan is a fatalist, and believes that nothing
can occur which is not ordained; there is no free will and all is
in the hands of Allah. There are, however, certain philosophers who
discuss this point and who say that it is wrong to lay every evil
action on the back of the <i>mektoub</i>.</p>

<p>For instance, they say that a man who deliberately buys a bottle
of wine and drinks it has no right to say that God predestined
this. These philosophers are, however, in the minority, and ninety
per cent of the Arabs believe that they are powerless to avoid what
is fated.</p>

<p>The Arabs say, “When God created the world he took a handful of
dust in either hand, cast it to right and to the left. The dust to
the right was destined to be people who would always be happy and
inherit paradise; the dust to the left only contained woes and
eternal damnation.” “God created you, you and all your actions,”
Koran Sourate, XXXVII. That is to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_117">[117]</span> say that all, good and bad, are decided and
determined by the Almighty. Sins are predestined and are divided
into two categories, the greater and the lesser. The greater
comprise theft, adultery, usury, wine-drinking, false witness. The
smaller are the weaknesses of human nature, but, whatever they may
be, man is destined to commit them, and nothing can prevent him
from so doing.</p>

<p>That is why Arabs take life so calmly, never hurry, or get into
unnecessary tempers when things go wrong. They firmly believe that
what is written is written, and that no power but God can alter it.
Taking them as a whole, it makes them seem very happy, and it would
appear to be the only solution to the worries of modern life.</p>

<p>From this point of view are developed many other beliefs, and it
is the basis of the strength of the Moslem faith. Mohammed, though
a great religious genius and a reformer, was not a theologist, and
it is even curious to note the lack of dogma in the Koran. His
great merit was the way in which he created a great and living
organization. His successors developed the theological side of the
matter, but, if one examines the Koran itself, one is struck by the
absence of mysticism. It is, in itself, more a book of laws, such
as the Old Testament. The whole of the theology is really
compressed into two passages occurring in Sourates II. and IV.,
which, summed up, convey that the true Mohammedan who wishes to be
saved must believe in God; the prophets or envoys of God, with
Mohammed as the greatest; the angels, the inspired books—that is to
say the Bible, with the Koran as the most important; and the Day of
Judgment.</p>

<p>They further believe in heaven and hell, which are depicted very
roughly as places of happiness and torment. Above hell is a bridge
as narrow as a hair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
and as sharp as a knife-blade, across which the souls of the dead
departed must pass to enter heaven. The sinners slip and fall into
hell, while the righteous cross safely with the aid of the sheep
into heaven. Mankind is divided into three categories—those who
deny Mohammedanism are destined to eternal fire; those who believe
in one God, but who, being sinners, pass through a state of
purgatory before going into Paradise; those few strict Mohammedans
who go direct to heaven.</p>

<p>Hell is very hot; there is nothing to eat but <i>dari</i>, the
bitter fruit of a thorny desert bush, and only boiling water to
drink. Heaven is a glorious garden where youth always remains and
where the blessed lie on carpets beside ever-flowing streams
beneath the shade of fruit-trees, drinking a delicious wine which
does not intoxicate, while young girls, ever virgins, sit beside
the water and live in a state of contemplative happiness. In other
words, hell is an accentuation of all the hardships of life in the
desert, while heaven promises all those things which an Arab has
never seen on earth.</p>

<p>Quite apart from the Koran, and apparently contrary to its
principles, is the belief in saints. The origin of this cult is
difficult to find, as the whole basis of the faith is that there is
only one God. It is, however, generally supposed that it is a relic
of other religions which existed prior to the spread of Islam. This
theory is rather confirmed by the fact that more saints and
<i>marabouts</i> exist in North Africa, where the Carthaginians and
the Romans held such long sway, than in any other Mohammedan
country. Other people will say that the worship of saints is
necessary owing to the inexpressible greatness of God—his distance
from all things human, which necessitates some kind of
intermediary; but this has little foundation<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_119">[119]</span> to stand on, for even among the most
superstitious Mohammedans, who are always invoking some holy man,
you will always hear them murmur during their prayer, “There is no
God but Allah.”</p>

<p>The veneration of saints is in reality a respect for the life of
the person concerned. It may be that his asceticism and his charity
have raised him above others; it may be that his exploits in the
name of Islam have made him famous; it may merely be the fact that
he is easier to visualize than God—the fact remains that he is
venerated and that his aid is invoked in times of trouble. But
whether he be merely respected as an example of what a true
believer should be or whether he be actually called upon as a
protector, he is not considered as divine, nor in any way
approaching the one and only God.</p>

<p>Apart, however, from what we call superstitions of the actual
faith, there are countless others which do not come into the
religion, and which, while all have the same origin, differ
according to countries.</p>

<p>A few words have already been said on this subject, but it is
felt that, in order really to understand the Arab, the question
must be further developed.</p>

<p>The belief in spells and witchcraft seems a contradiction in a
people wrapped up in religion, but it will never enter their heads
that bringing supernatural powers to bear on the matters of this
world, be it for good or for bad, is placing oneself on the same
footing with the Almighty.</p>

<p>They maintain that, as angels exist, djinns and other creatures
of the underworld are just as comprehensible, and can be invoked in
the same way to carry out requests. Again and again one will meet
people who will tell you that dragons live, and that there are
people who have seen them and have spoken to them! All sorts of
animals are supposed to bring<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_120">[120]</span> good or evil luck, and amulets with the
feet of lizards, the feathers of the hoopoe, the tooth of a jackal,
can be seen attached round the necks of babies.</p>

<p>The Koran is always placed in the cradle of the newly born, and
there are people who keep pages of the Holy Book to hire out to
those who can not afford to buy one.</p>

<p>It would take far too long to go into all the details of these
superstitions which are held in reverence all over North Africa,
and, though at first sight they may seem to be much the same as
those told in more civilized countries, they are not really
believed elsewhere to the same extent as in North Africa. I will
give an example of a case of witchcraft which occurred only the
other day in a family which I knew intimately, a family educated
and acquainted with the way of the modern world.</p>

<p>A man tiring of his wife and wishing to marry some one else who
refused to share the home, divorced his first wife, who was devoted
to him. She made no protest, but, with the aid of certain learned
<i>talebs</i>, set about weaving spells about her ex-husband. The
night of his wedding the <i>taleb</i> said to the woman:</p>

<p>“Prepare a great feast for all your friends, with music and
dancing, and at midnight your husband will return to you.”</p>

<p>She complied with his instructions, and at the midnight hour
there was a banging on the door, and the husband in a dazed state
appeared, imploring his wife’s forgiveness. She at first refused to
see him, and it was not until he had returned a third time that she
allowed him in.</p>

<p>I made an investigation of the case, and I talked to those
involved, who all corroborated the story. The husband told me that,
just as he was about to see his new bride, he felt himself impelled
toward his first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
wife. He struggled against the feeling, but in vain, and before he
knew where he was he had left his wedding and was before the door
of his late parents-in-law’s house. All this was explained, of
course, by the working of the spell, and any contradiction of this
was considered as the disbelief of an infidel; the facts were
there, and there was nothing further to be said.</p>

<p>I have known cases where some one has desired to spread discord
in a household, and in a short space of time the discord has arisen
without the mischief-maker speaking a word to the parties
concerned. I have seen men commit the greatest follies and trace
them to the intention of some other person who has invoked the aid
of a djinn.</p>

<p>To my mind the explanation is hypnotism—the effect of strong
will on the mind of some weaker person; perhaps auto-suggestion,
but certainly mesmerism carried out secretly.</p>

<p>This, combined with the absolute belief in fate, assures that
thorough absence of any sort of free will which makes the weaving
of spells easy, and it is difficult to make even the better
educated Arabs scoff at its possibilities. All is predestined, and
the casting of spells therefore can not be avoided.</p>

<p>What is the good of going into the matter further? It would only
lead to unnecessary controversy and a disbelief in God’s power.

<span class="sc2">ABD-EL-KADER</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">It would</span> take too long to cast even a
cursory glance over the many holy men venerated in Algeria, and it
will suffice merely to touch on the two most important. Some
confusion appears to exist in the minds of many as to who
Abd-el-Kader really is. The name is spoken of all over North
Africa, and is often discussed at cross-purposes. The fact is that
there are two Abd-el-Kaders, both of great importance to the Arabs,
but as different one from the other as possible.</p>

<p>The first, whose <i>kouba</i>, or shrine, can be seen in
practically every town all over North Africa, and whose full name
is Abd-el-Kader-el-Djelali, was born in the twelfth century
<span class="sc2">A. D.</span> at Djel near Bagdad. God said of
him:</p>

<p>“If I had not sent Mohammed before thee to earth, I should have
chosen thee as my prophet.”</p>

<p>He is, therefore, venerated as only second to the founder of the
Faith. He was apparently a man of proverbial goodness, who spent
his life in protecting the poor and the oppressed, whose broadness
of mind extended to listening to the prayers of Jews, as well as to
Christians, and who was the most merciful of all saints. The
miracles attributed to him are innumerable, and the legends would
fill volumes, but to the practical mind the greatest miracle seems
to have been the range of his travels. Quite apart from the
places<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> he visited
in other countries, he seems to have sojourned in every center of
importance in Algeria.</p>

<p>With his roan horse he stopped in the cities of the coast, in
the villages of the mountains, in the oases of the Sahara, doing
good to those about him, helping those in distress who invoked him
at great distance. Space seems to have meant nothing to him, and in
every place where he rested a <i>kouba</i> was erected in his
honor, and thither the faithful flock regularly and light candles
in the shrine and pray for his blessings, while on fine nights they
congregate and sing his deeds.</p>

<p>It is said that his death was caused by God selecting him to
suffer three-quarters of the diseases which fall yearly on the
earth, and that, when suffering and near to death, the angels came
and placed him between the third and fourth heavens, for the Koran
says:</p>

<p>“God created the seven heavens, and placed them one above the
other.”</p>

<p>From this point of vantage Abd-el-Kader remains, and watches
over the sufferings of the Faithful.</p>

<p>The other Abd-el-Kader, already mentioned earlier in this book,
was a no less famous character than his predecessor, the
<i>marabout</i> after whom he was named. The son of Mai-ed-Din, who
claimed direct descent from the Prophet, he was born in the year
1808, and when quite a boy made a pilgrimage to Mecca. During this
pilgrimage it is recounted that an angel in the form of a Numidian
appeared to Mai-ed-Din and prophesied that one day his son would
reign over all North Africa. The boy was intelligent, and spent
much of his time studying and interpreting the Koran; and when,
therefore, the French landed at Sidi Ferruch in 1830, he felt that
his day was at hand. His father had been appointed leader of the
Holy War, but it was felt that he had not sufficient personality
nor prestige to carry the Faithful to victory, and,
remembering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
the prophecy of the dusky angel, Abd-el-Kader was elected
<i>emir</i>, and made his solemn entry into Mascara on November 25,
1832.</p>

<p>For the next fifteen years his military career is one of the
most remarkable in history. His successes were no doubt slightly
due to the ever-changing principles of the government in Paris, but
a man of smaller personality would not have succeeded in not only
holding at bay, but in defeating an army containing veterans of the
Napoleonic campaigns and equipped with all the modern implements of
war. Furthermore, he was an able diplomatist, and employed all
kinds of intrigue to compromise with the French when he felt that
he could not meet them successfully with the sword.</p>

<p>His renowned piety and his descent from Mohammed raised him in
the eyes of the Faithful to a position above all his followers, and
one of his greatest achievements was the uniting of all the tribes
of Algeria in a common cause. Even when reverses lost him some of
his adherents, he was always able to gather them together again at
the most critical moment and turn upon his astonished enemy, who
thought that his end had come. General after general was sent in
his pursuit, but returned with the same tale to tell: an elusive
enemy, all mounted, which retreated before an advancing column
until it was exhausted or on ground suitable for their maneuvering,
then a rapid encircling movement, wild attacks on horseback, and
the destruction of the expedition. The French would then try
pacific measures and make a truce. Abd-el-Kader accepted these
overtures, and employed wise emissaries, which allowed him time to
reconstruct for further victories. Now and then he was badly
beaten, and, evading capture, would flee with a few faithful
followers to the mountains or across the Moroccan<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span> border. The tribes which
fought for him would disappear, disowning their leader, and for a
time there would be peace. Then the French would make some blunder,
expose some lonely garrison to attack, and the <i>emir</i> would be
up and at them. One small victory would be sufficient to bring all
the diffident tribes flocking about his standard again, and the
wearying war would recommence.</p>

</div>

<p>What strikes one most in all his career of victories, of
reverses, of days of triumph, of moments of desertion, is the
perseverance and the faith of the man. At no time was he sure of
his people, at all times he was certain of the fate that awaited
him at the hands of his enemies, and yet he continued fearlessly to
the end. His mobility is almost unbelievable. In a country where
roads were unheard of, where the land was overgrown with thick
brush, among towering mountains and flooded rivers, he moved with
the utmost rapidity. His victories at Mascara in the far west, at
Constantine in the east, in the plain of the Metidja, and at Aïn
Mahdi in the south give a slight idea of the enormous area
covered.</p>

<p>Moreover, it was not merely an army of lightly armed horsemen
who swept over the land behind the youthful general. His
<i>smala</i> consisted of thousands of camels, with tents and
jewelry and armories, and the families of all the great chiefs,
who, though they were kept well in the rear, were always present to
celebrate the victories.</p>

<p>It was finally Bugeaud, the veteran of Soult’s army in the
Peninsular War, who succeeded in conquering Abd-el-Kader. The old
Marshal realized that it was useless to employ the methods of
orthodox war against this elusive enemy, and he therefore decided
to create mobile columns to pursue the rebels. In the year 1843 a
terrible blow was dealt to the <i>emir’s</i> prestige.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> His great <i>smala</i>, which
had now become a sort of perambulating capital, with schools to
teach the children and <i>kadis</i> to administer justice, was
surprised by the Duc d’Aumale near Taguine and completely
destroyed.</p>

<p>In spite of this, however, the struggle was kept up, and, after
taking refuge in Morocco for a short time, Abd-el-Kader reappeared
again. But, though he won a few more victories, his end was near,
and in December, 1847, he asked for peace, specifying, however,
that the French, in return for his surrender, should allow him to
retire to some other Mohammedan country. His terms were accepted,
but unfortunately were not kept by the Government of Louis
Philippe. He was taken to France, and imprisoned first of all at
Toulon and then at Pau, and finally at the Château d’Amboise.
Finally, in 1852, Louis Napoleon, then Prince President, visited
the exiled <i>emir</i> and granted his wishes. He was transported
to Damascus, where he lived in peaceful retirement until his death
in 1883.</p>

<p>These pages are too short to go into all the detail of the
astonishing career of one who wished to be the hero of Arab
independence in Algeria, and to those whom the subject interests
let me recommend the excellent work of Colonel Paul Azan.</p>

<p>Some people have wished to compare Abd-el-Kader to Abd-el-Krim
of the present day. It would take too long to discuss these points
here, but it can be safely said that there is no comparison
possible. In the first place, the caliber of the two men is very
different; the intelligence of the hero of a hundred years ago was
far superior to that of his Moroccan cousin, and, though possibly
Abd-el-Krim may have had the same dreams as those which inspired
Abd-el-Kader, he never held the same prestige in North Africa.
Abd-el-Kader was alone, with ill-armed followers
fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span> against a
trained army, and beating them in the open over an area as large as
France, while Abd-el-Krim, supported by all kinds of European
adventurers, merely held at bay the armies of two European nations
where the conformation of the ground made his task comparatively
easy.</p>

<p>Abd-el-Kader will always remain a great figure, not only in the
history of North Africa but also in that of Islam, as one who
defended the Faith against the invasion of the infidel and who died
a friend of his former enemies.</p>

<p>This work is not a history nor a political treatise, but merely
a handbook for tourists and students of the country, and the name
of Abd-el-Kader has only been used to clear up any misunderstanding
which may arise when the name is raised: the one Abd-el-Kader,
saint and reformer; the other warrior and defender of Islam.</p>

</p>

<h2><a id="c18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<span class="sc2">ARAB EDUCATION</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Generally</span> speaking the Arab of Algeria
is uneducated, and though he is lazy, this lack of education is not
fundamentally his fault. In the first place, the instruction he
obtains from his own people is singularly primitive. The Koran
decrees that all children shall be taught their religion; at the
time of its compilation this involved reading and writing of
Arabic, but as in Algeria the original pure language has
disappeared, and its place has been taken by this mixture of Berber
and other tongues which have crept into it during the course of the
various invasions, its object as a channel of education has
disappeared.</p>

<p>The language of the Koran has, however, not changed in the
least, with the result that to read the Holy Book an Arab must
learn a completely new language, richer perhaps than any other in
the world and full of grammatical rules which take time to fix in
the mind.</p>

<p>It stands to reason, therefore, that the number of people who
can talk this language are in the great minority, but the order of
the Koran must be obeyed. What, therefore, is the result?</p>

<p>A little boy is sent to the local <i>taleb</i> or Arab teacher
at the age of seven, and he is supposed to remain there until he is
fifteen or sixteen. Here he learns the Koran in the old tongue by
heart, reciting in chorus with the other pupils the verses and
chapters without the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_129">[129]</span> smallest idea what he is saying.
Occasionally he finds a teacher who will take the trouble to
explain the scripture and give a few comments on what he is
learning, but usually the lad leaves his school with the Koran
engraved on his mind like some incomprehensible poem. Naturally he
forgets all this very quickly, and though his family teach him his
prayers, which are extracted from the Book and are translated, this
is all he knows of Arabic. The rest of the sense of his religion is
picked up by hearsay, and it may seem astonishing to a stranger to
note how much he does know about the laws of the Prophet. It is
not, however, as astonishing as might be supposed if one realizes
what I have said before, that the whole of his daily life is
interwoven with religion, and that if he did not know all this it
would be just as if a European remained all his life ignorant of
the simplest laws of his country.</p>

<p>The girls are not taught anything by the <i>taleb</i>, as,
though the Koran implies that all children should attend the
school, the Arabs consider that if their daughters were thus
educated they might get to know too much, and as an old <i>kadi</i>
once said to me, “A woman who could read and write would find it
too easy to communicate with her lovers.”</p>

<p>At home a few have to say the various prayers, but usually their
only instruction consists in weaving burnouses and carpets. They
also are instructed in the art of cooking; their apprenticeship on
these lines is very thorough, and they would beat any professional
in a carpet-making competition. Their cooking is, of course,
entirely Arab, and is often excellent, especially the pastry and
the cakes. The rolling of the <i>kous-kous</i> is their speciality,
and though in European households only men act as cooks, they have
to hand over the preparation of the <i>kous-kous</i> to women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that as far as the Arab teaching
goes, little boys and girls of an Arab family are practically
ignorant of anything except the Koran by heart and household
duties. There is, however, a French law which orders all parents to
send their male children to the local school. This law is enforced
more or less according to its locality. Generally speaking, in the
north the children are sent to school as the parents realize the
benefit gained by a knowledge of the Roumis’ affairs; the Kabyles
are an exception, and they do all they can to escape from this
foreign imposition.</p>

<p>In the south, too, education is avoided by the nomads, for no
natural dislike, but merely because the parents of the children
consider that they are more useful at home helping them with their
work than in learning to read and write. As, however, there is a
law about school-attending, it would seem difficult to evade it,
and whereas in the case of the nomads it is quite an easy matter,
the people of the oases have to try to get round the schoolmaster.
This seems incredible at first unless one knows the mentality of
the French <i>fonctionnaire</i> far away in the desert. Isolated
from his kith and kin and living on small pay, he does not feel
really bound to educate all the little wanderers who, he knows,
will not profit by his labor.</p>

<p>Those who do attend school are taught to read and write,
geography, French history, and a little arithmetic. They usually
leave their studies at fourteen and remember nothing a few years
after, except the reading and writing. Those who stay on can
develop their studies until they reach a standard which permits
them to go up for the local examination enabling them to get small
scholarships in secondary schools or at Lycées. Those who do very
well are educated free at the École Normale, and on
leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span> are posted
as teachers in the French schools. For others there is the Medersa
and all the legal situations mentioned in a previous chapter.</p>

<p>These pupils have to learn literary Arabic at the local school,
and on this one subject they are, generally speaking, very
thoroughly educated.</p>

<p>Quite apart from the official masters, there are the White
Fathers and White Sisters. These good people have posts in all the
far-flung posts of the French colonies, and their devotion to duty
is an example to all. Founded by Cardinal Lavigerie about 1865,
their work in North Africa is beyond all praise, and they have done
more to pacify the country than any soldiers or politicians. They
do not try to convert their pupils, but teach them some trade or
occupation, at the same time instilling into their minds principles
of good living and moral obligations. The White Fathers produce
some wonderful leather work from their workshops, and the Sisters’
carpets are the best examples of Arab workmanship one can find.
They also run a small school where they teach all elementary
matters, including religion. The Arab children do not usually
attend these classes but the Jews do. I have talked to Jewish
parents on this apparent contradiction of their principles, but
they have replied that the teaching of the Sisters is so much
superior to that of the lay schools that they prefer their children
to receive it, and the parents can always counteract at home any of
the Christian doctrines.</p>

<p>The Lycées in Algiers, and for that matter in France, are open
to all Arabs who like to pay to send their sons there. Some Arab
chiefs make a point of doing so, but it is noticed that the boys do
not really reap the benefits of this education but return to their
homes without much more knowledge than their brothers who have
studied in the local schools, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_132">[132]</span> with all the vices of the Europeans with
whom they have come in contact.</p>

<p>What does strike an Englishman is the enormous proportion of
Arabs who talk fluent French. In India it is the officer and the
official who have to learn Urdu to make themselves understood among
the natives; in Algeria it is the native who must learn French.
This is carried to such an extent that in some of the <i>communes
mixtes</i> of the north the little Arab boys are not learning their
own language as a channel of conversation.</p>

<p>The south is different, as only a few nomads can say a word of
French, but in time the language of the conqueror will impose
itself into the farthest recesses of the Sahara. It is another
example of the results obtained by an administration which at first
sight seems a contradiction to all sense, and which yet produces
wonderful results.</p>

</p>

<h2><a id="c19"></a>CHAPTER XIX<br>
<span class="sc2">SPORT AMONG THE ARABS</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> Arab who has not become softened by
life in European towns thinks more of sport than of anything else.
His greatest ambition is to own a horse, and the possession of a
breech-loading gun is a dream he rarely realizes. With his old
muzzle-loading blunderbuss, however, he does wonderful shooting,
and rams down the charge with amazing rapidity.</p>

<p>Game of all kinds abounds in Algeria—partridge, hares, woodcock,
bustard, pigeons, quail, wild boar, gazelle, moufflon, and
occasional panthers in the mountains. I will discuss the various
methods of shooting the animals as employed by the Arabs, as, with
rare exceptions, sport in the country is organized by them. Small
game is either walked up or driven; usually driven, as the areas
are so wide and open that it is difficult to approach within range
of the birds. Hares can be walked, and they make very pretty shots
as they dart round the tufts of alfa; the bustard seems to be a
bulky target and does not appear to fly very fast, but is not too
easy to hit. Dogs are taken out, but they are badly trained, and it
is preferable to leave them at home and rely on native boys to pick
up the game.</p>

<p>The most interesting way of hunting the small game in the south
is mounted, with hawks. The breed is a kind of small falcon, and
unlike those trained in India and other countries, which once
captured are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span> kept
as long as they can fly, these hawks of North Africa are caught in
the autumn and are released again in the spring as soon as the
molting season begins. What is still more curious is that the same
birds are found again the following year by the falconers, with
their young, to be trained for the first time. A hawk is an
expensive luxury, and costs four or five hundred francs to buy,
while a falconer must be mounted, clothed, fed, and paid a salary.
But it is a noble sport, and perhaps one of the most picturesque in
the world.</p>

<p>A meeting-place is fixed, and the party rides out in twos and
threes, or, in the case of the rich, send on their horses, and
motor there in comfort. When every one is assembled a long line is
made, converging at the two extremities so as almost to make three
sides of a square; the falconers, with the birds, capped, perching
on their turbans or shoulders, ride in the center. The horsemen
slowly advance. Suddenly there is a shout—a hare has got up; the
line steadies its pace, for it is against all rules in any way to
hunt the hare until the falcon has got to work. This does not take
long, however, for in a second a bird is uncapped and is soaring
rapidly up into the air, a second bird has followed it, perhaps a
third.</p>

<p>Up they go, flying swiftly above the hunted beast. Suddenly the
first falcon swoops down toward the earth, then up again. He has
missed, but before the hare has got over this first escape the
second falcon comes down; if he misses, the third is there; and,
with cries of delight, the Arabs ride up to see the prey held
firmly in the falcon’s talons as he pecks savagely at the head.</p>

<p>All this may take five minutes or half an hour. If the hare gets
a good start or if the falcon does not see it, at once there is
gallop across country, driving the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_135">[135]</span> hare in as straight a line as possible by
hemming him in on either flank. It is advised in this case not to
try to guide the horse, but to let it pick its way among the tufts
and holes in the mad pursuit across the rough ground. Many hawks
are often loosed, and one may see eight in the air at the same
time.</p>

<p>The prettiest sight, I think, is to see a hawk tackling a
bustard. The bird gets up heavily, and at first flies low,
apparently slowly, but not too slowly for the hawk, whose wings
twinkle high up in the sky. After a minute or two the bustard
decides to rise; in doing so it loses distance, and the hawk, at
the critical moment, stoops and with a graceful upward movement
seems just to skim over the large bird’s back, turning on itself
again like an aeroplane looping. There is a little shower of gray
feathers, the bustard seems to stagger, and then spins down to
earth, while the falcon remains high above, marking the place where
lies the body.</p>

<p>More often than not, the quarry gets away, and it is then a
little difficult to gather in the hawks. The falconers, with loud
cries, wave the carcass of a dead hare round their heads until the
birds, one by one, return and are capped till the next hunt.</p>

<p>The shooting of bigger game is contrary to all British ideas of
sport. The art of stalking is practically unknown.</p>

<p>The wild boar which infests the Atlas range, and especially the
mountains of the coast, is driven through the thick undergrowth and
killed with a shotgun at short range.</p>

<p>The gazelle of the Sahara is hunted in different ways. The most
common method is on horseback. A party of five or six will ride out
on to the plain where gazelles are known to be pasturing. As soon
as the animals are sighted the horsemen approach
cautiously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
endeavoring to place themselves on the flank of the herd. The
moment the hunters are seen, up go the heads of the gazelles, and
in a second there is a wild stampede. At the same time the horses
leap forward and the pursuit begins.</p>

<p>If the preliminary maneuvering has been well carried out the
line of horsemen will be galloping one behind the other parallel to
the gazelles, and little by little the distance separating the
hunters from their quarry is lessened.</p>

<p>Suddenly as the leading horseman comes within range he drops the
reins on his horse’s neck, raises his gun and fires. His companions
follow suit and an intermittent broadside continues until the herd
breaks up into terrified groups fleeing in all directions.</p>

<p>The party halts, retainers who have been following hurry up and
cut the throats of the dead gazelles, as even in sport the laws of
the Prophet must be observed.</p>

<p>It is an exhilarating sport but it needs a little practise to
hit anything when both hunters and hunted are at full gallop. It is
moreover recommended to use a high-backed Arab saddle and also to
ride at the rear of the line, as excitement often makes the Arabs
shoot carelessly.</p>

<p>There are others, merely hunting for food, who go out before
dawn when the herds are all lying down, approach as near as
possible, and then blaze away as soon as it is light enough to see.
Some sportsmen hunt them with the native greyhound, but, as this
entails much leisure with often no results, the sport is dying out.
I have seen gazelles hunted from a motor-car. The vehicle goes
bumping across the desert until a herd is seen, and approaches as
near as possible. As soon as the animals get the wind they are off,
and the car is off after them. As in the case of the hunting
on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> horseback, the
gazelles at first go much faster, but they are soon overtaken and
the car rushes along beside them while the occupants discharge
their guns into the terrified herd. It is a massacre, but the
shooting is not so easy as it sounds and the driver of the car must
have courage and judgment. Sometimes it is impossible to get level
with the gazelles. In these cases the object may be achieved by the
mere tooting of the horn! Nine times out of ten this will cause the
gazelles to stop, the car then stops too, and the tooting continues
at intervals until—marvelous to relate— the animals begin
approaching to see what the noise is. At this moment the heathen
kills just as many head as he wants.</p>

<p>There are few dishes more delicate than a roast haunch of
gazelle, and the cutlets melt in one’s mouth.</p>

<p>The moufflon—which is not really a moufflon at all, but a sort
of goat resembling very closely the animal which is known as the
sharpu in Kashmir—is very little hunted. In the first place, he
lives in very inaccessible mountains, chiefly in the Aures above
Biskra and in the Djebel Amour near Laghouat; secondly, he is
getting scarce, and thirdly, his meat not being very tender, is not
sought after. If the Arabs see one they shoot it with a shotgun
regardless of sex or age; and the European who wants to stalk must
understand the game thoroughly himself, be a good mountaineer, and
merely employ natives to guide him to the likely spots. It is one
of the most astonishing things to see how completely ignorant the
Arabs are of all questions of wind or light; their only idea seems
to be to rush up to the beasts as quickly as possible and kill in
quantity.</p>

<p>But, if the sportsman will take trouble and get into touch with
some of the rare Arabs who enjoy this kind of shooting, he will
have some excellent sport and get quite good heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
</p>

<p>Panthers are very rare nowadays, and keep away in the highest
peaks where there are forests or thick undergrowth. Only when it is
very cold do they come down to lower levels and kill a few sheep.
The moment their presence is known all the neighboring villages are
up in arms, and the wretched beasts have not many days to live.</p>

<p>Jackals and foxes are also shot, as they do a great deal of
damage to flocks, and their skins are tanned and sold. Hyenas
frequent the plains of the Northern Sahara.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, the Arab who is at heart a good sportsman
considers that any form of hunting not connected with a horse is
more a means to obtain food than anything else. There are, of
course, the great chiefs who will organize regular shoots for their
friends as is done in Europe, but it is not very general.</p>

<p>Horse-racing is encouraged, and, though it is carried out in
rather a wild method, with little attention to handicapping, it is
very highly thought of. Every Arab knows how to ride, be he a
soldier, a merchant, or a cook, and the smallest boy will mount his
steed without fear or hesitation at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>What strikes one, however, is the little care the average man
takes of his horse. He very rarely grooms him, he feeds him on any
sort of fodder available, and when in camp he hobbles him in a way
which is almost cruel. He uses a heavy saddle based on a wooden
framework, and the bit, though light, is often rusty. It is nothing
for a nomad to do thirty miles a day on an animal which has never
smelled a handful of oats in its life. In spite of this, however,
the horses seem to thrive, and those who are properly cared for
answer to the treatment in an incredibly short space of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
</p>

<p>All along the coast, sea-fishing abounds, but it differs in no
way from the same sort of fishing all over the world. The
river-fishing inland is not worth speaking about, but it exists,
and the rather bony fish which is caught often makes a pleasant
contrast to the eternal meals of mutton and game.</p>

<p>This, roughly speaking, is the sport of Algeria. There are, of
course, private individuals—European farmers—who do a certain
amount of preserving, but they are in the minority, and rarely ask
others than their neighbors to share in their shoots.</p>

<p>Game exists everywhere, and, if the sportsman will take trouble,
he can have as good fun with gun and rifle as in any country, but
he must do it all himself.</p>

<h2><a id="c20"></a>CHAPTER XX<br>
<span class="sc2">THE NOMADS</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> nomads are the descendants of the
original Arabs who invaded North Africa in the seventh and twelfth
centuries. Here and there they have been slightly Berberized, but
generally speaking they are quite a separate type from the
inhabitants of the rest of Algeria. Tall, and tanned by the sun,
they look fearlessly before them as they move with that easy gait
of men born and bred in the open plain. Their feet and hands are
shapely, and though not actually good-looking they have very fine
faces, with an expression of great calm.</p>

<p>Their clothes are much scantier than those of their brethren of
the towns. Usually there is just a <i>gandourah</i> tied about the
waist with a leather girdle, bare legs, the feet encased in
untanned leather boots, a very rough turban on the head, and a
threadbare burnous. Over the shoulder is slung an antique
muzzle-loading gun, while in their hands is always a long
staff.</p>

<p>Their womenfolk go about unveiled and have little pretention to
beauty, which is probably due to the hard life which they lead.
They wear simple frocks, sandals and a kind of turbaned head-dress
made of many scarfs wound one above the other. Their hair is thick
and plaited round the head, leaving two coils to hang out on either
side.</p>

<p>The accent of a nomad is quite different from that of the other
Arabs; it is deep and guttural, much<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_141">[141]</span> softer than the tongues of the mountains
and of the north.</p>

<p>The hardest thing to realize when one meets these people is the
fact that none of them ever possessed a permanent home or actually
resided in a house. They were born under the tent, they were
brought up there, married there, and they will die and be buried
under a little heap of stones. Their whole outlook on life has been
the open plain, the sky, the storm, the rain, the fierce sun of the
Sahara; even the visits to the market towns have been fleeting. The
family, which means everything, has been centered round the group
of tents.</p>

<p>These tents are not, as might be supposed, gorgeously decked
residences or even the tents we associate with shooting expeditions
in India. They consist of a kind of very large blanket made of
coarse camel’s and goat’s hair. This blanket is placed on posts and
pegged down on three sides leaving the fourth open. On the floor
are placed rugs and carpets, and in the case of a rich nomad one
may sometimes see colored hangings on the walls, but this is rare,
as simplicity is preferred.</p>

<p>When the man is married the tent is divided into two by another
blanket and the man lives on one side and his wife and children on
the other. When the camp is struck the posts are removed, the
blanket is rolled up with the carpets and the whole is placed on
the back of a camel or donkey.</p>

<p>On some of the camels one may occasionally see what are known as
<i>bassours</i>. They are a kind of palanquin consisting of a
framework of wicker hoops covered over with drapery, and inside
which travel the women and children. The men either walk or ride
horses or donkeys.</p>

<p>In the old days, before motor-cars had come into<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> being, the caravan of some
southern chief moving to his summer quarters in the north was a
very noble sight. It consisted of some hundred camels bearing all
his family and his household goods. The <i>bassour</i> of the
important ladies was draped about with the brilliant trappings of
his tribe and was surmounted by a banner above which shone a brass
crescent. All the men rode beautiful horses richly saddled, and the
flocks spread themselves about the caravan as far as the eye could
reach.</p>

<p>Occasionally one sees this sight nowadays, but very rarely, and
only in the far south where roads have not penetrated. To-day the
Arab chief sends his family by rail or by car, and it is left to
the shepherds to travel in their old-fashioned and picturesque
style.</p>

<p>There are, however, real nomads of great wealth who own hundreds
of flocks and whose caravans are necessarily very large, but they
do not go in for any kind of pomp. It is a most astonishing thing
to meet one of the old heads of families, dressed so simply that he
might be a humble workman, and realize that he is the owner of
thousands of sheep which represent a fortune not to be sneered at
in Europe. Here he lives, however, all his life on the desert with
his fifty tents or so, his family and retainers growing up about
him, but without the least desire to better himself or live in a
house.</p>

<p>Most of the <i>caïds</i> of the south live this way, and those
who inhabit the towns are exceptions, and are merely there for
business reasons or because contact with Europe has made them
soft.</p>

<p>The camp of my shepherds, which consists of eight tents,
comprising some fifty persons, is a very typical example of the
average group of nomads. It moves according to the pastures; that
is to say, it remains in a place as long as there is enough grazing
in that area<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> and
then it moves on to the next feeding ground. The camp forms the
center or headquarters, and in it dwell all the women and children.
At dawn the shepherds get up, count the sheep and disperse into the
Sahara, where they remain with the flocks until the evening, when
they return to the camp. The sheep are again counted, and the
evening meal is taken in each separate home.</p>

</div>

<p>When I am there the head shepherd, and perhaps the head man of
some neighboring camp, dine with me, and then all the other
shepherds come and sit round my fire to smoke or tell stories till
bed-time. The women, though unveiled, rarely appear and they are so
silent that one hardly realizes they are there, but they prepare a
very excellent meal and with apparently no materials weave all the
tents and clothes for their menfolk.</p>

<p>In the winter we move only a few miles at a time, from pasture
to pasture, but when it begins to get hot and the grazing scarce
the whole camp is packed up and we set out for a long journey to
the mountains in the north. It takes a fortnight or so to cover the
two or three hundred miles to our summer quarters. Here the area is
much more restricted, and the camp remains much longer in the same
place until the time to move south comes round again in the
autumn.</p>

<p>Market-day in the villages of the Tell during the summer months
is a most interesting sight. All the tribes are there—Larbas,
Chambas, Ouled Naïls—outnumbering the regular inhabitants, and one
hears the deep voices of these people from the Sahara, and in the
evening the southern pipe is played in all the cafés.</p>

<p>The rich chiefs who live in the oases usually have their country
homes in the mountains, and those who have not are usually related
to the local magnates and spend the summer with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
</p>

<p>There are, of course, a great many nomads who never leave the
south at all, but wander about all the year in the Sahara. The
pasture is very scarce, but there is just enough for the sheep and
they get all the benefit of the first autumn rains. Nomads have
prejudices about moving out of their own areas and prefer to remain
in a country they know.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately difficult to get to know these people well.
They are timid of strangers, and as they can not speak one word of
French the visitor must have a very fluent knowledge of Arabic to
make himself understood. They are suspicious of being exploited,
very quick of temper, and where honor is concerned do not hesitate
to use the knife or the gun. They are very childish in their jokes,
and if they see that one means no ill they soon become attracted
and friendly. Their women are, generally speaking, chaste, and
though there are intrigues, which usually end in some one getting
murdered, they are the exception.</p>

<p>A little story of an incident which occurred in a neighboring
camp to mine will perhaps illustrate the mentality of these
people.</p>

<p>A rich nomad possessed a good-looking wife who was much admired
by a <i>sheik</i> who, owing to business reasons, lived in an
oasis. The <i>sheik</i> owned flocks himself, and he often had to
pass the night near the camp where dwelt the object of his
affections. He courted her on the sly, and though the lady
regularly rebuffed him he was in no way deterred. One night it so
happened that he had to sleep in the camp of the rich nomad, and he
lost not a moment to press the lady to grant him his requests. At
first she refused, but after a while she seemed to relent, and told
him to wait till she made a signal and then to creep under the
blanket which divided the men’s section from the woman’s, and come
to her. The young man was in his seventh<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_145">[145]</span> heaven, and when all was quiet he was duly
called, and crept toward his lady-love. When he was quite close she
whispered to him to take off all his clothes. He complied with
alacrity, and when he was in nature’s garments the woman turned to
him and said:</p>

<p>“So this is how thou repayest the nomad’s hospitality!”</p>

<p>The young man gazed at her speechless.</p>

<p>“I am now going to wake up my husband,” she continued, turning
to where the old man slept.</p>

<p>In a moment the young <i>sheik</i> was on his knees imploring
mercy, begging forgiveness, swearing fidelity, trembling at the
thought of the fate which would surely await him if the threat were
carried out. The woman watched him disdainfully for a moment.</p>

<p>“Coward!” she said at last. “Had I seen that thou wast prepared
to meet thy fate like a man I should have respected thee and
perhaps accorded thee a favor; as it is thou art not even worthy of
the knife of my man; thou canst go!”</p>

<p>The lover made as if to take his clothes.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” she said, smiling, as she laid her hand on the
bundle, “a craven needs no garments. Go; quick, quick, or I shall
rouse the whole camp!”</p>

<p>The youth looked at her, and seeing the look of determination,
slunk out on to the plain, found his horse, and was obliged to ride
naked to the oasis; and there is no humiliation greater for an Arab
than to be seen without any clothes on.</p>

<h2><a id="c21"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br>
<span class="sc2">SHEEP-BREEDING</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Having</span> talked about the nomads we must
now cast a glance at their occupation. Of all the many industries
in Algeria, sheep-breeding is the oldest, as perhaps it is in all
countries where pastures are unlimited and where lack of
communication makes it difficult to set up big commercial towns.
Moreover, the Arab is essentially a shepherd by instinct, and
living a wandering life with no fixed abode but his camel’s hair
tent, it is immaterial to him where his sheep pasture, and it is
amazing to note the vast tracts of country crossed by a flock
during the course of the year.</p>

<p>Messieurs Bernard and Redon say in the <i>Histoire,
Colonisation, Géographie et Administration de l’Algérie</i>:</p>

<p class="space-above2">“The Moghreb (original name of Algeria
before the Phœnician settlements) is especially suited for the
cultivation of cereals, vines and olive-trees, and for
sheep-breeding. . . . the Numidians were excellent horsemen who
lived by pillage and by the produce of their great flocks.”</p>

<p>Further, speaking of the invasion of the Hillals in the twelfth
century, they say:</p>

<p>“The newcomers were fierce nomads who did not invade as did the
first Arabs, in small groups, but in hordes, millions of men
followed by equally vast flocks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
</p>

<p>The greatest sheep-breeding centers are in the southern part of
the department of Algiers, some two hundred miles from Algiers, and
right away to the south as far as Ghardaïa.</p>

<p>There is also a certain amount of breeding in the southern
tracts of Oranie and in Constantine, but the inhabitants of these
areas are more interested in cereals, and the Arabs of Biskra are
specialists in dates.</p>

<p>The district known as the Sersou, on the high level above the
Sahara, must not be forgotten as one of the finest pasture-lands of
Algeria, but the majority of the flocks there have come up from
Laghouat and Ghardaïa to escape the intense heat of the summer.</p>

<p>Many people who have only visited the country in a superficial
or tourist manner, are filled with incredulous surprise when they
are told of sheep-farming in the Sahara.</p>

<p>“But what do the sheep eat and drink?” they exclaim.</p>

<p>It is difficult to explain this to those not versed in the
constitution of a sheep, but when one realizes that in winter a
sheep can go for three months without drinking, and finds
nourishment and water in the rough scrub which grows all over the
Sahara, it is not surprising that these great flocks thrive and
that the sheep grow as fat as their cousins in Europe.</p>

<p>Presumably if an animal is brought up to live on scrub and do
without green grass it has no taste for other nourishment, and
there is little doubt that if a camel was let loose on the Scottish
moors it would be unable to assimilate the rich food owing to the
formation of its digestive organs.</p>

<p>However, whatever the best diet for a sheep may be, the result
is enormous flocks all along the northern belt of the Sahara, which
are a source of great revenue<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_148">[148]</span> to the Arabs. Few Europeans have ventured
into this business, in the first place, because the Frenchman has
not that adventurous spirit which characterizes the British
colonist, and in the second because unless one knows the country
and its people well it is difficult to enter on a venture of this
kind alone. But those who have had the courage to start are
delighted and amazed at the results.</p>

<p>First of all the original capital required is comparatively
small, three hundred to five hundred pounds being sufficient to buy
the first flock; and second, the return is large and very rapid.
Given an average year, the investor can count on a regular annual
thirty to sixty per cent. net for himself on his money after paying
all expenses, including the remuneration of his Arab partner.</p>

<p>The expenses are negligible; they need hardly be taken into
consideration. They consist of market fees (only at the big markets
where there are tens of thousands of sheep for sale), shearing
fees, and a small pasturage tax when the flocks are in the north.
The shepherd of each flock is paid in kind. That is to say, he is
given an old burnous (Arab cloak), a few measures of barley and
twelve to fourteen lambs each year. No further expenditure is
required, and though losses occur occasionally from drought, there
is never a hundred per cent. mortality.</p>

<p>Since 1900 there have been only two of what are known as famine
years. During those two years sheep died at a rate of from fifty to
sixty per cent., but this is a very exceptional occurrence.
Curiously enough years like this which are disasters to some are
windfalls to others. The people who suffer are those who have not
sufficient reserve funds to be able to hold out during the bad
period and who are obliged to sell out. Those, therefore, who are
not entirely dependent on<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_149">[149]</span> the sale of their sheep to live, buy up
from the poorer breeders at negligible cost. When there is a
mortality of thirty per cent. it is considered very bad, but this
happens perhaps once in seven years, and even then one has the
remaining seventy per cent. from which to continue breeding. The
average mortality does not exceed ten per cent. and it has been
known as low as three.</p>

<p>The system of working the flock is for the European capitalist
to enter into an agreement with an Arab: a chief of some tribe or
some native of good reputation owning flocks of his own. Through
him all the purchases are made at the various markets, or direct
from the nomad tribes as they pass through the district. He is
responsible for all dealings with the Arabs for the pastures, for
the selection of shepherds, in fact for all the technical work to
do with the natives, which no European could possibly cope
with.</p>

<p>At the end of each year the profits are estimated and after
sharing expenses, half goes to the Arab partner. This may sound
excessive, but when one considers that he is responsible for the
whole of the breeding, and that without him it would be impossible
to do the business without being robbed of eighty per cent. of the
profits, it is not too much. Moreover, in the unlikely case of dead
loss the Arab partner bears half. There have been one or two rare
examples where Frenchmen who know the country well, and who can
speak the language, have launched forth on their own; they have
found that after a year’s work the flock has been mysteriously
stolen by some migrating tribe and that it can not be found. What
redress has the Frenchman? He can have the shepherd imprisoned if
he can find him, but this won’t return him his sheep or his money.
On the other hand, when an Arab loses a few sheep he has every
redress possible from his<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_150">[150]</span> colleagues and friends, the chiefs of the
district, who will set all the tribes in such a hum that it is not
worth while for the robbers to conceal the spoil long.</p>

<p>The way these nomads track a lost flock across hundreds of miles
of stony areas baffles all comprehension. I have seen a man track
thirty-five strayed sheep from Chellala to Ghardaïa, over two
hundred miles of the most desolate country, and never make a
mistake until he reached the sheep. During the tracking he crossed
the spoor of some thousand other flocks, but he hardly hesitated in
his relentless march, whereas I could not see as much as a mark on
the stony ground. I remember at one moment I expressed my amazement
at this apparent witchcraft. The Arab chief, my partner,
laughed.</p>

<p>“Look,” said he, “what do you see on the ground?”</p>

<p>I peered down and, after a long scrutiny, I said doubtfully. “It
is something like the print of a man’s foot, but I am not
sure.”</p>

<p>The Arab smiled.</p>

<p>“It is the print of an unmarried girl of the tribe of the
Chambas,” he replied without hesitation.</p>

<p>In amazement I looked at him.</p>

<p>“But how?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I can not describe to you the difference between the print of
an unmarried girl and a woman without having the two prints before
me,” he replied, “but I know.”</p>

<p>“But the tribe?” I exclaimed incredulously.</p>

<p>“There is a date-stone beside the foot-mark,” continued the
Arab, “which only comes from the palms which grow in the land of
the Chambas.”</p>

<p>I said no more. That night we came to a group of nomad
tents.</p>

<p>“Ask them who they are,” said the chief, smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
</p>

<p>I hailed them and a voice from the dark said, “Chambas!”</p>

<p>No, I do not think that half the profit is too large a
remuneration for the Arab partner. . . .</p>

<p>At the end of each working year, that is October till September,
the final settlement of accounts takes place. If so wished the
entire flock can then be sold. Moreover, this can be done at any
moment, and it is a point to be noted that the money invested is
never immobilized, as there is always a market for sheep, and like
other commodities the price follows the rate of the dominating
currency on the money-market. If the wisest course is followed,
merely selling the produce (lambs, wool and butter), leaving the
original flock intact, it will be found that in a good year the
capital will be reimbursed at the end of the first season, while
the flock remains as profit to go on breeding from. If from this
moment one contents oneself with the sale of butter and wool only,
which bring in ten per cent., and one keeps the lambs, one will see
the original flock multiply itself into many flocks in an
incredibly short space of time.</p>

<p>The Arabs among themselves never keep any regular accounts, but
gage their fortunes by flocks and keep as little ready money as
possible. When they want to buy a horse or a motor-car or a wife,
they send so many flocks or portions of flocks to the nearest
market and pay their bill with the proceeds. If some of them ever
realized their livestock, they would find themselves on a footing
with some of the big fortunes of Europe with every luxury at their
disposal. But they prefer to remain living quietly in their Arab
centers, content with the mercies of Allah, opposed to all thoughts
of the future, for after all, Allah is almighty, Allah will
provide, and if he does not, <i>mektoub!</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c22"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br>
<span class="sc2">OTHER PRODUCTS</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Apart</span> from the breeding of sheep on the
Hauts Plateaux and in the Sahara, we also find cattle-raising in
the Tell and in the coast hills of the department of Oran, while
horse-breeding is carried on all along the southern slopes of the
Atlas. The cattle are not very big, and would compare sadly with
any European breed, but they bring in a comfortable little revenue
to the breeder and suffice for the needs of the country.</p>

<p>Horses are more in the hands of the Europeans, who have created
some quite good centers for improving the strain, but generally
speaking, the fiery steed associated with pictures of Arab life is
conspicuous by its absence, and, though one can get an average
mount for the asking, a really fine horse is hard to buy.</p>

<p>The breeding of camels, mules and donkeys is entirely in the
hands of the Arabs and is of little interest financially.</p>

<p>Algeria is, however, essentially an agricultural country and has
been so ever since the days of the Romans. Unfortunately the
richness of its soil and the abundance of sunshine is handicapped
by the lack of regular rain, and the farmers live always in fear of
drought.</p>

<p>Dams have been made across some of the big river-beds which are
full of water in winter, but they are not so complete as in the
days of the Romans. Two thousand years ago Algeria was the granary
of a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span> empire;
now in good years it exports a vast proportion of its cereals, but
in a bad year it has to import. Wheat, barley, oats are grown all
over the department of Oran, and in the center and the south of
Constantine. There is also some grain in the department of Algiers,
and little by little the sowing is extending. This is due a great
deal to the energy of the manager of an American firm, the
International Harvester Company, which has proved to the Algerian
farmer the amount that can be done to improve production by using
modern methods and perfected machinery.</p>

<p>The vine, though it does not cover nearly so large an area as
the cereals, is considered as of almost greater importance.</p>

<p>It is some fifty years since the first Frenchman came to Algeria
in search of soil not infested by phylloxera and attempted planting
vineyards. The results were so amazing that more and more people
hurried over the Mediterranean, and in twenty years the land was
producing ten times the amount of wine as at the start. This,
however, nearly led to disaster, as there was suddenly a glut of
wine on the market and the prices dropped to nothing. However, the
system was soon reorganized, and Algiers now exports a seventh of
its production to the mother country. This wine, being stronger in
alcohol and in color than French wine, is used for blending
purposes. Many of the Burgundies and Bordeaux which do not come
from some specific vineyard are half Algerian, and practically
three parts of the <i>vins ordinaires</i> served in French cafés
come from over the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In Algiers itself there are certain well-known <i>crus</i>, such
as La Trappe de Staoueli, a plain wine, Medea, and Miliana from the
hills.</p>

<p>In Oranie, too, there are one or two small
wine-producing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
districts, such as Mascara; but practically all the vineyards are
in the department of Algiers, and center round the plain of the
Mitidja and the adjacent hills. All modern improvements for
pressing and fermenting have been brought in, for as the picking
takes place in the heat of summer, the fermenting is a very
delicate operation.</p>

<p>Phylloxera has been practically stamped out and though drought
is feared, it has not the same disastrous effects as on the
cereals, owing to a certain amount of irrigation.</p>

<p>The great danger is a sirocco just before the <i>vendange</i>.
It seems unbelievable, but I have seen entire vineyards withered up
in six hours under the blast of this terrible hot wind from the
south. One can actually see the leaves turning brown and the
bunches of grapes shriveling, just as if a fire had been lighted
beneath the vines. Luckily this only happens once in a while, and
the average years are good.</p>

<p>The wine is strong and rather heady, coarse in comparison to the
French wines, but very well suited to the rather special food of
the country.</p>

<p>In the same district as the vine we find the mandarin, orange,
and lemon plantations. Protected by cypress-trees, the golden fruit
is grown in large quantities, and exported daily during the winter
months.</p>

<p>A curious herb known as geranium is also grown on this fertile
plain. It is made into perfume, and supplies the base for cheap
scent. A great deal of it goes to England, and, curiously enough,
the only other country where it is cultivated in quantity is
Mauritius.</p>

<p>All along the coast east and west of Algiers we find the
market-gardens for early vegetables. The expert labor is chiefly
supplied by Majorcans and Sicilians, and during a good year it is a
most profitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
occupation, as the markets of Paris and other big centers are
supplied from these tiny seacoast gardens.</p>

<p>Next in importance comes the tobacco industry. The best
plantations are along the coast east of Algiers, in the lower
levels of the Kabyle country, and, again, in that wonderfully
fertile plain of the Mitidja. Provided one can obtain the suitable
soil, it is one of the most profitable products to exploit—little
cost, and none of the worry or expense incurred by the Regie, as in
France. Moreover, it is quite a high-class tobacco, and some of the
cigars are really quite good smoking, while the pipe tobacco and
the cigarettes can be offered to the most <i>difficile</i>. It is
much healthier smoking as there are no foreign matters or mixtures,
but just the pure leaf, which differs according to district.</p>

<p>Figs are grown in great quantity in the Kabyle Mountains, and
are exported. In the prolongation of the same mountains and all
along the coast to Tunisia the cork forests abound. This industry
is much developed, and English and American firms vie with the
Algerians to obtain concessions and export the cork to their own
countries.</p>

<p>The olive-tree is indigenous to Algeria, and grows wild on all
the mountains. In certain centers the trees are grafted, and the
olives are plucked and oil extracted from them.</p>

<p>Apart from the fruit-bearing trees, however, the forests of
Algeria are few and far between. Here and there one comes upon
magnificent cedars and pines, but it is not a wooded country, and a
great deal of the timber is imported.</p>

<p>There are people who maintain that Algeria was once covered with
forests, and that the same state of things could be reproduced. I
am not of this opinion; in the first place, because of the absence
of practically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span> any
coal, and second, by the fact that the country is, and always has
been, essentially agricultural.</p>

<p>There are minerals of many kinds in Algeria, but never in great
quantity. Iron, zinc, lead and copper have been found, but they are
not worked, merely taken out of the ground and sent to Europe.</p>

<p>A little oil has been tapped in Oranie, but up to the present
not in sufficient quantity to make its development interesting from
a commercial point of view. The same can be said of the small
coal-field discovered near Colomb Bechar, in the south of the same
department.</p>

<p>The most interesting product of the soil is phosphates, which
are found in great quantity in the department of Constantine,
whence they are exported daily from the ports of Bougie and
Bône.</p>

<p>Hot springs abound in Algeria, and, with the exception of Hammam
Rhira and Hammam Meskoutine, are not developed. It is a pity, as
they have excellent healing qualities, and those people with
rheumatism who have frequented the baths at Hammam Rhira are
delighted with the results.</p>

<p>Before leaving this subject we must once more turn our eyes to
the Southern Territories, in order not to forget two of the most
important industries of the country: the date-palms and the alfa
grass.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly the date worthy of exportation thrives only in
certain restricted areas where the temperature and rainfall are
exactly suited. However, when this occurs the owner of a palmery
can count on a very substantial income.</p>

<p>The alfa grass, which grows wild all over the Sersou and Hauts
Plateaux, is divided up into concessions, owned chiefly by British
firms, and it is exported to be made into paper.</p>

<p>This is already a very dull chapter, and I will not<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span> weary the reader with any
further dissertation on commerce, but I hope that, after reading
this <i>résumé</i> of the products of Algeria, he will realize what
a rich country it is, and what a future of prosperity lies before
it. The Phœnicians guessed its value; the Romans realized it; the
Arabs forgot it all; and the French are beginning to complete what
the Romans began. Well may they prosper!</p>

<h2><a id="c23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br>
<span class="sc2">ALGIERS</span></h2>

<p>Now that we have before us an outline of the history, geography,
administration and customs of the country under examination, it
seems opportune to say a few words about Algeria from the point of
view of the tourist.</p>

<p>The traveler visiting this country will either journey direct by
sea to Algiers or else will take the overland route via Paris and
Marseilles, which is the more rapid. In either case he will arrive
by sea.</p>

<p>His first impressions of Algiers, rising out of the
Mediterranean like a white bubble in a sea of sapphire, will be the
best he will have of this once Turkish city, now a vast commercial
town and only a little less noisy than Marseilles. The sight of the
Arab quarter, piling itself up in a pyramid of white and blue roofs
above the European houses, with the fresh gardens of Mustapha away
to the left and the Turkish forts in the foreground, is a vision of
delight. And though, once landed, the smell of Oriental people and
the red-fezzed porters may rouse for a moment a sense of the East,
this atmosphere will not last long.</p>

<p>Algiers of to-day is essentially a big commercial town of over
two hundred thousand inhabitants. Owing to the configuration of the
ground it has spread east and west, giving it a sea-front of some
ten miles. Inland the houses have crept up the hills as far as
possible, but in many places it is too steep to attempt building,
and one- or two-storied villas are the general<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_159">[159]</span> rule. Most of these villas are
lamentable modern constructions, but there are a few which date
from the old Arab days, and in which there are a multitude of
lovely marbles and tiles of the period. These villas were occupied
after the French conquest by followers of the victorious army, and
later, when Algiers was discovered as a winter resort, they passed
into the hands of English hibernators.</p>

<p>In those days the life on the Mustapha Hill was brilliant and
amusing. The English colony was composed of well-to-do people who
spent half the year in these Arab villas, while those who had not
permanent residences settled in the few local hotels. An English
club flourished, and a real society existed. But all this is gone.
The facilities of transit, the mechanical age in which we live, and
newly acquired wealth have dispelled all this pleasant life.</p>

<p>The English hibernators who inhabited the picturesque villas
have in many cases been supplanted by foreigners, and those who
remain are not much given to entertaining, so that it is rare for
the outsider to get more than a glimpse of the multi-colored tiles.
Great hotels have sprung up, rivaling one another in a second-rate
atmosphere of the Riviera; Swiss waiters do their utmost to keep up
the illusion, but the lack of elegance handicaps them.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the visitor is not seeking gossip and bridge in
overheated drawing-rooms, or the company of summer boarders from
Bexhill and the relics of our great Indian Empire, he will do well
to stay just long enough in Algiers to collect his breath, and then
penetrate into the interior and see the real life of the country.
If, however, he is not of an active nature, he can find excursions
round about Algiers, but it will be at the cost of submitting to
the gala nights of the Mustapha hotels, of the unsyncopated music
of lamentable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
orchestras, while the middle-aged ladies of fashion sit round
criticizing the few youthful or well-dressed creatures who have
strayed by accident into this mediocre society.</p>

<p>Algiers is not Algeria, and its people are wisely called
“Algerois,” as against “Algeriens.”</p>

<p>The commercial city about the port is interesting from the point
of view of any one desirous of examining the development of a
growing city. Eight great banks do a brisk business, which alone
speaks for the trade passing through Algiers. The harbor, which is
now being more than doubled in size, will, when completed, rival
the largest ports of the Mediterranean. The biggest battleships and
liners of the world can berth comfortably in its shelter, and there
is rarely an hour in the day when merchantmen are not approaching
or leaving its quays. Everywhere there is an atmosphere of booming
trade, and it is undoubtedly a fact that, if Algiers had an
independent government with an independent exchequer, the franc
would be a good deal nearer par with the pound sterling than it is
at present.</p>

<p>The visitor has, however, probably not come to this sunny
country to go into statistics and business opportunities, and it
will be sufficient, therefore, if he drives through the town with
the knowledge that he is in the midst of a trading-center which in
a few years will stand on a level with Lyons and Bordeaux.</p>

<p>The “sights” of Algiers can be done easily in one day, as they
are all concentrated about the Kasba (literally fort, but here the
name given to the Arab city). The most interesting building to see
is the Governor’s winter palace, formerly the residence of the dey,
and until a few years ago occupied by the Governor-General. It is
now used for official receptions, as government offices, and for
exhibitions. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
great deal of the original building has been spoiled by the
improvement put in by the military engineers, but there remain some
lovely tiles and woodwork which, apart from their many historical
associations, make the visit worth while.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>The Archbishop’s palace opposite is a typical Arab house with
some fine tiles, while the Public Library, once the house of
Mustapha Pasha, is one of the finest examples of Moorish
architecture and contains more beautiful tiles. While speaking of
these tiles it would perhaps be well to say a few words about their
origin. During the period of Turkish rule in Algeria, when the
corsairs roamed the Mediterranean, it was the custom to bring the
prisoners back to Algiers. Some of them were held for ransom, and
the ransom imposed either took the form of money or of tiles from
the countries whence came the prisoners. If among the prisoners who
were captured there were found artisans who understood building or
the creation of these tiles, they were employed in constructing and
beautifying the houses of their captors. Hence in all these Arab
villas one finds Florentine, Milanese, Dutch and Persian tiles. In
one of the villas of Mustapha there is even a record of the
capturing of an English sailor who was kept by the Turks for some
years.</p>

<p>The Grande Mosquée, built in the tenth century <span class=
"sc2">A. D.</span>, differs little from other mosques. The Mosque
of Sidi-Abd-er-Rahmane is worth a visit as the resting-place of the
patron of Algiers.</p>

<p>The actual Kasba is a picturesque series of narrow streets
climbing up the hill from the Winter Palace to the Fort l’Empereur:
so-called because it was here that Charles Quint for a brief moment
made his headquarters. It is very dirty and smelly.</p>

<p>If one can obtain access to a private house one will have an
interesting peep at a simple interior<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_162">[162]</span> contrasting vividly with the riches of the
palaces, and from the roof one will obtain a marvelous view of the
Arab city. A visit at night is also recommended, when the dirt will
be invisible and the flickering lights in the dark streets and the
Moorish cafés, with their musicians, carry one away from the
modernisms of the great commercial town which throbs so close. In
both visits it is recommended to start from the top and walk down
toward the sea.</p>

<p>The Admiralty or headquarters of the French Navy in Algeria lies
to the north of the harbor. It used to be the headquarters of the
pirate chiefs, and it was in its lofty chambers that the raids and
expeditions were planned, while below, in the shelter of the tall
breakwaters, the fleet waited for its orders. There are some very
fine tiles and rather massive architecture, also a series of powder
magazines, dungeons, and a remarkable torture-chamber, outside
which is an inscription telling it is the site where Christian
hostages were blown to pieces at the mouth of the cannon.</p>

<p>In one of the cells Cervantes was imprisoned. The visit to the
Admiralty is, however, impossible unless one knows a naval officer
on duty in Algiers or has a pass from one of the government
officials.</p>

<p>The Jardin d’Essai, a little to the east of the main city, is
interesting if one has not seen Kew, and the Arab cemetery above
the Kasba discloses a pretty view of the hills behind Algiers; but,
generally speaking, Arab Algeria will not be found in Algiers. And,
though some of the buildings are very lovely, they are all relics
of the barbarous rule of the Turkish conqueror, and they do not
represent anything appertaining to the country.</p>

<p>With the inrush of commerce Algiers has lost its charm, and
there are no other compensations. Even<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_163">[163]</span> the climate is disappointing. The winter is
wet, and, though there are glorious days of sunshine, the
atmosphere is relaxing. December is a good month, as are also
March, April, and May; the others are either too wet or too
hot.</p>

<p>Let the tourist, therefore, make up his mind to spend his
holiday traveling, or even in repose in one of the Sahara oases,
and he will return to his home with an impression of light and
freshness and with a sensation that he has thrown off all the cares
of the modern world. If he will take the humble advice of one who
knows the country, he will follow in the tracks of the journey
described in the next chapters, and, if color and contrasts appeal
to him, he will probably return in the succeeding year to these
entrancing scenes which never weary the eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br>
<span class="sc2">TWO EXCURSIONS</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Before</span> setting out on the long journey
through Algeria, two short excursions from Algiers seem worthy of
mention. The first is an afternoon drive to the easterly point of
the bay of Algiers. The distance is barely twenty miles, and though
there is nothing in particular to see there, the drive along the
coast from Maison Carrée is delightful, and the view from Cape
Matifou of Algiers, shimmering white in the distance, is
enchanting. Practically no tourists ever go there, and though in
the summer the little fishing-village of Laperouse is inhabited by
Algerian families who can not holiday in France, in the winter it
is deserted.</p>

<p>It is recommended to drive out via Maison Carrée, Fort de l’Eau
(the Algerian ape of Deauville in the summer) and the village of
Cape Matifou. A mile farther on a sharp turn is taken to the left,
and in a few minutes one reaches Laperouse. Passing through the
village a rough road leads one to the point on which stands the
lazaret used for the quarantine confinement of pilgrims returning
from Mecca.</p>

<p>If there is a storm in the Mediterranean, the sea dashing itself
against the cliffs is a magnificent sight, and the view of the
spray bursting over the rocks to the east makes one realize how
restless is this inland sea. From the cape one should return to
Laperouse, take a look at the little fishing-port, very quiet
during the winter months, and then, asking the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_165">[165]</span> way to the ruins, picnic in the old
Roman bath which overlooks the miniature bay, so blue and calm even
when the breakers are roaring against the point.</p>

<p>The ruins are those of Rusgunium, originally a Phœnician center,
and later converted by the Romans into a summer watering-place.
Unfortunately, with the exception of the baths, practically all
vestige of the houses has disappeared; this is not modern neglect,
as the stones and mosaics were taken by the Turks to build Algiers
of that day.</p>

<p>If the weather is fine it is strongly recommended that one stay
until the sunset, as the spectacle of the sun disappearing behind
the hills of Algiers, making of it a great brazier of flame,
compensates one for the drive back in the dusk. But really to
appreciate Laperouse it must be visited on a summer day. The heavy
atmosphere of Algiers is left behind, and one finds oneself in a
sea of light and freshness. The water lazily laps the cliffs and
ripples up on the golden sand. It is never too hot, as the breeze
comes from over the sea and, bathing on the hottest day, one can
not stay in the water for more than half an hour. The nights are
cool, and the twinkling lights of Algiers across the bay, while the
summer moon flashes in the tranquil sea, equal a vision from the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>.</p>

<p>The second excursion is to the west of Algiers to Tipaza and, if
time permits, as far as Cherchell. It is advised to do it in two
days, as there is much to be seen and little time to appreciate all
in a short winter’s day. If, however, time is pressing, Cherchell
can be omitted and Tipaza alone visited.</p>

<p>The actual distance is some fifty miles, and the road runs
delightfully along the coast all the time. The way is bordered by
endless vegetable gardens, for it is along this part of the coast
that all the <i>primeurs</i> are grown for the Paris markets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
</p>

<p>Castiglione is a pretty little village on the sea coast, as is
also Berard, but as in the case of Laperouse they must be imagined
in the summer full of holiday-making Algerians. A little beyond
Berard can be seen a strange-looking object on the top of the hill,
resembling a very large beehive. It is in reality a mausoleum known
as the <i>Tombeau de la Chrétienne</i>. To visit this it will be
necessary to leave the car and climb up a steep path some six
hundred feet above the sea. On reaching the pyramid one is struck
with a certain similarity with its cousins in Egypt and, in fact,
there is reason in this resemblance. One hundred and twenty feet
high, with a diameter of one hundred and eighty feet, it is
composed of great blocks of stone rising in tiers, and is said to
have been built by Juba II. Juba II, it will be remembered, was the
son of Juba I, defeated by Cæsar at Thapsus in 46 <span class=
"sc2">B. C.</span> The boy was taken to Rome and brought up most
carefully by Octavia, Cæsar’s sister, and was ultimately married to
Cleopatra Selene, the daughter of Antony and Cleopatra. In 43
<span class="sc2">B. C.</span>, when the Roman Empire was finally
established and the second triumvirate had divided the territory
among its members, Octavius restored the old kingdom of Numidia,
and in 30 <span class="sc2">B. C.</span> appointed Juba II as its
king.</p>

<p>Cæsarea, now Cherchell, became his capital, and for fifty years
was the most magnificent city of North Africa. The <i>Tombeau de la
Chrétienne</i> was constructed as the mausoleum for his wife.</p>

<p>There is no real evidence for this story, and many will say that
the tomb is much before the time of the Romans. However, the fact
remains that this edifice is quite close to the capital of Juba’s
kingdom, and that there is another monument practically identical
in construction near Batna, in the department<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_167">[167]</span> of Constantine, which is known as the
tomb of Syphax, another Numidian king, and that they both have a
certain resemblance to the Pyramid of Cheops.</p>

<p>The road continues along the seacoast, delighting the eye by the
contrast of the sapphire blue of the Mediterranean lapping the deep
red rocks fringed with brilliant green scrub. Eucalyptus woods are
passed until the road runs down to the little fishing-village of
Tipaza. The Hotel du Rivage is an excellent inn nestling against
the red cliffs, while the garden runs down to the miniature port,
little changed since the days of the Phœnician traders.</p>

<p>If time is not of importance, a few days spent here in peace and
quiet will not be regretted. Originally a Phœnician settlement,
Tipaza became in the first century of our era a Roman summer resort
for the rich settlers in Cæsarea (Cherchell). All that could be
done to make it a center of luxury and pleasure was carried out
with infinite care. The temples, the forum, the villas were
designed to harmonize with the beauties of nature.</p>

<p>Thanks to private enterprise much of the ruins has been
unearthed and one is able to reconstruct this town as it was.
Sarcophagi of great beauty have been found, and mosaics in a very
good state of preservation have been placed in a small museum by
the hotel.</p>

<p>The joy of the place is not so much the actual finds, but being
able to realize again the pleasant atmosphere which must have
reigned among the wealthy Romans as they walked up and down the
forum, which dominates the bay, or dined merrily in the villas
looking down on the rippling sea.</p>

<p>Later, when Christianity appeared, there must have been a very
fine church to the west of the original town, whence one gets a
delightful view of the sandy shore which runs along toward the
towering heights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> of
the Chenoua Mountains. Here, too, the heat-oppressed Algerians come
in summer to escape from the damp atmosphere of the white city, and
the bathing is wonderful.</p>

<p>Cherchell is some twenty miles farther along the coast. The
drive itself is not very interesting, and the town, after Tipaza,
is disappointing. There is, however, a very excellent museum, and
to those interested in the statues of Rome of that period the visit
is worth while. Otherwise the return journey from Tipaza can either
be made by the same way in the golden glory of the African sunset,
or else inland through the vine-clad hills via Marengo and
Kolea.</p>

<p>These are the two excursions, but this chapter can not be closed
without reference to the Trappist monastery at Staoueli. This is
only twenty minutes in a car from Algiers and is worthy of a visit.
The Trappist monks have been expelled, but their monastery, with
the great vats in which they made the still famous wine, remains.
The monastery is in the hands of Monsieur Lucien Borgeaud, a
gentleman of Swiss origin who has continued pressing the grapes as
did his holy predecessors, only on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>A visit is welcomed, and in addition to seeing the old building
founded by the Trappists at the time of the French conquest, it
will be interesting to see how wine is made and the modern
improvements put in by this enterprising Algerian.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many pretty drives involving part of the
day, such as the Gorges of Palestro and the entrance to the Kabyle
country, the Ruisseau des Singes, beyond Blida, Dellys, and the
Phœnician city of Tigzirt, on the coast, but as they form part of
the greater journey to be dealt with in the next chapters their
description is purposely omitted. Suffice it to<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> say that all the neighborhood
of Algiers is enchanting, and that life in Algiers itself, lived in
one of its old Moorish villas surrounded by a lovely garden, would
be as delightful if it were not for the relaxing climate.</p>

<p>But if we are to appreciate the real charm of the country do not
let us tarry too long near the white city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c25"></a>CHAPTER XXV<br>
<span class="sc2">A VOYAGE</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Though</span> perhaps the journey described in
these pages is longer than many tourists would wish to undertake,
it is rather set out with the idea of giving a notion of the amount
that can be seen in a comparatively short space of time and under
the easiest conditions.</p>

<p>The trip can, moreover, be divided into separate excursions as
indicated in the table of distances at the end of the chapter. It
is better to do this journey in a private motor-car, which enables
one to rest at will, eat by the roadside, and take photographs. But
if the traveler has not the means to progress in this luxury he
will find public conveyances at moderate prices on practically
every route mentioned. Sometimes it will be the train, sometimes
the motor-bus, and though in some cases he will be obliged to
travel by rather a roundabout way or occasionally wait a few days
for the bus, his journey will always be assured in comfort.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, there is a daily or even bi-daily motor
service on all the main roads of North Africa; and it is only in
the far south that the bus does not have a regular time-table.
Otherwise the times of departure and arrival are as fixed as for a
train. The motor-busses are covered and very comfortable, and to
the individual who is entertained by strange faces and gay chatter
about all that is going on in the country through which he is
traveling, the motor<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_171">[171]</span> <i>diligence</i> is a delightful
entertainment. In fact, if the traveler is bent on studying the
country and its people, he will do so much more advantageously in
the public conveyance than in the isolation of the private car.
However, if he is only on holiday or a pleasure trip the motor is
recommended, and it is with the idea of traveling thus that this
imaginary journey will be taken.</p>

<p>It is presumed that the period chosen for the tour will be
between December and April—January, February or March—and let it be
borne well in mind that North Africa in winter, even on the edge of
the Sahara, is not a warm country. The thermometer does not
actually drop very low, but the biting air of the mountains and the
sharp dry winds of the rolling plain or the Hauts Plateaux and the
Sahara make heavy coats and rugs essential.</p>

<p>Once south of Laghouat and at Touggourt the temperature is
definitely warmer than in the north, but hot days can not be
depended on before this latitude is reached. It is true that on the
edge of the Sahara the sun heat in the middle of the day makes it
impossible to go out bareheaded, but the nights are very sharp.
Once into the Sahara the nights are also cold, but in the day it is
pleasantly warm, and the overcoats and rugs can be put away; but
the return journey across the Kabyle Mountains may be done in a
snowstorm. The great thing to remember about Algeria is that it is
a country of extremes. The morning may dawn in a downpour of rain
and at noon one may lunch in the garden dressed in white. Crossing
the mountains during the winter one is practically certain to find
rain, but once on the Sersou it is almost always fine.</p>

<p>The Hauts Plateaux are bitterly cold, but as soon as one has
come down on to the Sahara the temperature<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_172">[172]</span> is very pleasant, and it rarely rains; when
it does, it pours for a few hours and then clears up.</p>

<p>Therefore, the warmest wraps for the journey in the north,
English summer clothes (not Indian or tropical) for the south. All
evening dresses, etc., can be left in Algiers, as there is never
any occasion to dress up, even when invited by an Arab chief. It is
advised to travel light, and linen can usually be washed by the
Transatlantic hotels in forty-eight hours. The question of hotels
brings me to another point.</p>

<p>The hotels of Algeria can be divided into two categories—those
which belong to the Transatlantic Company and those which do not.
The Compagnie Générale Transatlantique has opened up the whole of
North Africa by their circular and inclusive tours which run into
the wildest parts of the Sahara. In order to accommodate their
customers they have built hotels in all these remote spots, and
these are certainly very well organized. In all the more frequented
places there are other hotels for the accommodation of commercial
travelers and Arabs, and though they are usually quite clean and
the food eatable, that is about all that can be said for them.
There are usually no bathrooms and there is nowhere to sit except
in the public café. Here again let it be said that for the traveler
in search of copy the hotel with its Arabs and people of the
country is a source of perpetual entertainment, but with few
exceptions it is rough—very rough, and sometimes dirty.</p>

<p>The prices, of course, correspond to what one gets, but to the
holiday-maker the Transatlantic hotels can not be too highly
recommended. Good food, clean beds, running water, hot baths,
perfect service, reliable information on all that can be done and
not done, seem to warrant the fairly high charge, and yet not
high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> when one
realizes the difficulties which confront the hotel manager in
getting all this modern comfort in the wildest districts.</p>

<p>It is, however, recommended that one see the Transatlantic
Company in Algiers to make certain that there will be accommodation
as, if they are booked up with heavy tours, their own travelers
will naturally have preference over independent tourists.</p>

<p>The cost of the trip, quite roughly, will work out as
follows:</p>

<p>1. For the private car owner staying at the Transatlantic
hotels, one hundred to one hundred and fifty francs per person per
day. Petrol, etc., in addition. If a car is hired it works out at
about two to three francs a kilometer plus the board and lodging of
the driver, which is about thirty-five francs a day.</p>

<p>2. For the traveler by public conveyance staying at the local
hotel fifty francs a day will amply cover his living and
expenses.</p>

<p>Train fares are not dear, and the bus fares, though they vary,
do not exceed ten centimes a kilometer.</p>

<p>Equipped now with knowledge for the journey, it only remains to
trace the itinerary, which will be quite easy to follow on the
accompanying map. This information can be supplemented by the
guide-book, and in referring to the guide-book I always speak of
the <i>Guide Bleu</i> which, with the exception of a few slips, is
really very reliable.</p>

<h2><a id="c26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br>
<span class="sc2">BOU SAADA</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Leaving</span> the ugly suburbs of Algiers, the
car turns on to a broad, straight road bordered with plane-trees.
On either side stretch interminable vineyards, while ahead the blue
slopes of the Atlas rise up from this great plain of the Mitidja.
Little French villages are passed and long, white buildings, now
closed and silent, which will be in a whirl of activity in August
and September when the grapes are being pressed.</p>

<p>In an hour or so l’Arba has been reached and the steep slopes
covered with rough scrub and cork-trees. Up, up the road climbs
toward the bare crests of the range. Algiers and the Mitidja are
lost to view, and the eye wanders over a great expanse of mountain,
cultivated here and there with patches of cereals, and now and then
a vineyard.</p>

<p>The air is fresh, and the clouds seem ominously close. At
Sakamody the watershed is reached, three thousand feet above
sea-level, and a wonderful panorama of hills and rivers and forests
spreads itself before us.</p>

<p>The road is now running steeply down toward the silvery stream
at the bottom, and, reaching Tablat, an iron bridge is crossed and
away speeds the car through a fertile valley. If lunch has been
carried in the car there are some delightful fields near Bir
Rabalou—at the one hundred and third kilometer—where one can picnic
in peace. For some reason there is an abundance of tortoises in
these fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
</p>

<p>If one is depending on the hotel one must push on to Aumale,
where a rather second-rate inn will provide a correspondingly
second-rate lunch. Aumale is well over two thousand feet above the
sea; it is a modern garrison town and quite uninteresting.</p>

<p>Shortly after Aumale the road starts sloping down toward the
flat country parallel to and east of the Sersou, and after thirty
kilometers the village of Sidi Aïssa is reached.</p>

<p>At this point two vast errors are made by guides, tourists, and
even by many Algerians; and, as stated in a previous chapter, it is
the duty of the author to destroy legends invented for the ears of
the credulous.</p>

<p>The first of these stories is that Sidi Aïssa means “Our Lord.”
Translated literally this word signifies “the Lord Jesus,” but,
though the Mohammedans venerate all the prophets from Moses down to
Christ, this Sidi Aïssa is not the founder of the Christian faith.
The person after whom this village and many others are named is
Sidi-el-Hadj-Aïssa, the great <i>marabout</i> who founded Laghouat
in the eighteenth century. Of this later.</p>

<p>The second story, which is perhaps served up more frequently, is
that at Sidi Aïssa the desert begins. It is an excusable legend,
and let it be said at once that the author himself has fallen into
the trap. It is an absolute fallacy, but Bou Saada and its
neighborhood is one of the most amazingly natural fakes in the
world.</p>

<p>Sidi Aïssa is at one thousand eight hundred feet above the sea
and is on the same latitude as Boghar, which is perched on the
southerly slopes of the Atlas of the Tell. Bou Saada is actually
north of Djelfa, which the traveler will visit in two days and
which is at over three thousand feet.</p>

<p>“But what of this?” exclaims the reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
</p>

<p>Well, this—that the approach to Bou Saada is as desertic as any
scenery he will see, and that many oases of the south have that
same first aspect of the Sahara created by Bou Saada; and yet to
reach the beginning of the great wastes which run away to the
Soudan and the Niger, ranges of mountains and forests south of Bou
Saada must be crossed, which in winter are often covered with
snow.</p>

<p>Bou Saada is an oasis, of that there is no doubt, but why it
springs up in a country which is only a few miles from forests and
vegetation is not to be explained. Perhaps it is one of the great
jokes created by Allah for the benefit of the Compagnie Générale
Transatlantique—and a very profitable joke too! However, the
important point is that the traveler, on leaving Sidi Aïssa, can,
if he wishes, feel that he is entering the desert, but he must not
believe it. It is an impression which can not be forgotten, just as
if a boat had been exchanged for the car and one had put out to
sea. The hills and trees to the north seem to be the land, and the
great expanse of stone and scrub spread out before one is the sea.
To the west barren mountains rise up with almost flat tops,
reminding one of billiard tables built by some dead race of giants.
The world has suddenly changed as the car rushes on along the
straight, even road.</p>

<p>No one is in sight, no habitation—just the wide plain. If the
Sahara proper is to attract one the attraction will come now. There
is no question about this: the expanse of desert either takes hold
of one’s mind or else it merely bores.</p>

<p>However, bored or enthralled, the first aspect of Bou Saada must
seize one and make a thrill pass through the brain. The road
suddenly bends to the right, the sand-dunes appear all golden in
the evening light, a city of rosy mud houses nestles against a
russet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> hill,
fifteen thousand palm-trees bow ever to the lilt of the wind.</p>

<p>Such is the first glimpse of Bou Saada, “the father or place of
happiness,” and indeed so it must have been before the days when
motors made a week-end visit possible. The Transatlantic hotel is
comfortable, and constructed in harmony with the place, and though
the rest of the life is as great a fake as nature has made it, it
has great charm.</p>

<p>On arrival let the visitor hurry to the bastion below the
military hospital to see the glory of the sunset— those amazing
lights which he will see again in the south, but of which his first
impressions here will never be forgotten. A mantle of gold-dust,
the palm-trees in the breeze, herds of sheep and goats returning
from their pasture, stately camels plodding along into the city
accompanied by solemn Arabs: a vision of enchantment.</p>

<p>The return to the hotel, through the quiet streets in the
rapidly increasing dusk, while the <i>muezzin</i> calls the
Faithful to prayer from the mosque, is such a complete contrast to
the scenes of twenty-four hours before that one wonders if one has
only traveled a hundred and fifty miles.</p>

<p>Yet it is not the Sahara, and at night, after dinner, when one
is obliged to fall into the hands of the clamoring guides to be
taken to see the dancing girls of the Ouled Naïls perform their
weird steps, it is not the real thing. Not the real thing inasmuch
as the dances are organized for the tourist and do not go on
continuously for the native population, but as real as possible as
far as it concerns the actual dances and the fact that the girls
all belong to the tribe of the Ouled Naïls, in the center of whose
area Bou Saada lies.</p>

<p>Another disillusion to the veteran guide is
impending,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span> but in a
merciful spirit the truth about the Ouled Naïls will be kept till
the next chapter. As, however, the traveler has not yet been to the
far south, he will appreciate this evening in a quaint little room
hung about with gaudy carpets, or, if it is fine, perhaps on the
roof, watching the girls dance slowly up and down before him to the
squeal of the <i>raïta</i>, or to the deep notes of the reed flute,
while the time is kept by a rhythmical beat on the
<i>tam-tam</i>.</p>

<p>The stars are flashing overhead in a black sky and peace seems
to have settled on the world, a peace which will gradually increase
as the journey progresses into the Sahara.</p>

<p>Next morning it is advisable to take one of the small boys
outside the hotel (not a regular guide) and, descending into the
river-bed, walk along between the tall palm-trees until the end of
the oasis is reached, and then, crossing a belt of rough scrub,
climb up on to the golden sand-dunes. A great expanse spreads out
before one till, away in the distance, can be seen the beginning of
the Aurès Mountains. It is a land of strange mirage effects, and,
if the sun is hot, visions of palm-trees and green lakes will
appear and shimmer away again before the eye has grasped the
picture. If the country has taken hold of one, an hour’s
contemplation in these golden dunes will pass quickly.</p>

<p>After lunch there is an interesting little excursion to be made
some eight kilometers up the Djelfa road to El Hamel. The car
should not be overloaded, as there are three or four kilometers to
do off the main road up to the gates of the town. Built on the side
of a barren hill, it has a wild look, and its tall walls give it an
imposing aspect as the car climbs up the steep road to its gates.
El Hamel is interesting because of its <i>zaouïa</i> and Mohammedan
college for those studying<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_181">[181]</span> the Koran with a view to becoming
<i>muftis</i> or <i>imams</i>. Up to 1904 it had the peculiarity of
being under the patronage of a female <i>marabout</i>, Lalla Zineb,
and her tomb, much venerated, can be seen in a very lovely mosque.
At present there is a charming <i>marabout</i> who is always glad
to see visitors. He will show one round and offer coffee in his
rather gaudy reception-room. Though it is not usually known,
<i>marabouts</i> accept, and often expect, gifts of money,
ostensibly given for the <i>zaouïa</i>; it must be presented with a
speech explaining that it is a charitable donation.</p>

<p>There are many other pleasant excursions round Bou Saada if time
warrants a long stay but, if not, there are more interesting things
to see in the south which will entirely eclipse this false little
oasis.</p>

<p>I say false and at the same time it is an almost unjust epithet,
as, though the place is infested by conducted tours, they have not
yet succeeded in removing its original charm, or making of it a
middle-class fashionable resort like Biskra.</p>

<p>N. B.—Should it be impossible for the traveler to carry the
journey on to Laghouat and the far south, there is a track across
country to Biskra, some two hundred and fifty kilometers. Thence
the journey can be carried on as laid down in the itinerary.</p>

<p>The track starts on the way to El Hamel, and it is well to have
some one who knows it in the car, as there are no signposts and it
is very desolate. Moreover, it must not be attempted in wet weather
or after a storm, as there are many dried-up river-beds which
rapidly become torrents, and there are no bridges.</p>

<p>Otherwise it is an interesting journey, and the first sight of
the Sahara near Tolga is arresting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br>
<span class="sc2">THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE SAHARA</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Leaving</span> Bou Saada by the same road taken
the day before to visit El Hamel, though without turning off down
the track which passes the holy city, the car climbs up into a
rolling country of alfa—that tall alfa or esparto grass which grows
so abundantly all over the Sersou and the Hauts Plateaux, and which
is used extensively by British firms to make paper.</p>

<p>Large concessions are leased for lengthy periods, the grass is
cut and collected by Arabs between November and March, and brought
to convenient centers on camels. Here it is pressed into bales and
despatched by motor transport or by rail to the sea, where it is
shipped to Europe: a profitable business, but somewhat lonely for
the European superintendent who lives at the pressing depot on the
plain.</p>

<p>The country traversed during the first part of the journey is
very wild. Hills limit the broad horizon, bare of all vegetation;
they are the Mountains of the Ouled Naïls, and this time it is
impossible to refrain from speaking the truth about these people.
Now, it is generally believed that the women of the tribe of the
Ouled Naïl (which, incidentally, means <i>children of him who has
succeeded</i>) are all ladies of easy virtue, and that in every
dancing-place in North Africa this tribe supplies the performers.
It is, moreover, stated by many that prostitution among them is a
form of religion. Both these ideas are false.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
</p>

<p>In the first place, this occupation or trade did not exist as
such before the French conquered the country. The real facts are
these: the confederation of Ouled Naïls is the largest in Algeria;
it comprises twenty-one tribes and occupies a very wide area,
running all the way from Djelfa to Sétif in length, and almost as
broad in depth. It stands to reason, therefore, that in a great
many of the towns visited by travelers the Ouled Naïl women are
found in their own homes, or in the towns just bordering thereon.
Outside their own lairs, however, dancers of this tribe will be
found exercising the same profession among their cousins of other
confederations. The first reason for this is, again, the fact that
they are so numerous that they have migrated outside their own
haunts, and even outnumber the other women. The second reason is
that prostitution among the Ouled Naïl tribe is not considered a
dishonor. This is greatly due to the astonishing laziness of the
tribesmen, who are quite prepared to live on the earnings of their
women. In any other tribe a mother will bring up her daughter with
the idea of marrying well, having a home, and settling down to rear
children herself. A mother among the Ouled Naïl people will not
discourage her daughter from going as early as possible to the
nearest town to earn her living in order to provide a large enough
dowry to make a good marriage, or retire into prosperous inertia.
Most astonishing of all is the fact that bridegrooms are
forthcoming, and that the method employed to raise the money is not
considered dishonorable. Among the tribesmen of the Ouled Naïl,
moreover, these girls are so weary of the life they have led that
they make excellent wives.</p>

<p>There are naturally many families of great respectability, whose
daughters are as closely kept as those of other tribes, but they
are not in the majority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
</p>

<p>All this may sound very crude, but, as I have previously
endeavored to show, whatever may be the rights and wrongs of the
question, there is none of that sordid atmosphere associated with
the same thing in Europe.</p>

<p>About half-way between Bou Saada and Djelfa the mountains are
left, and a broad expanse of plain, sparsely cultivated, takes the
place of the alfa. In the distance a group of poplars appears,
behind which lies a walled village. The car passes through a
menacing gate and turns into a long, uninteresting street planted
with sad trees. Of all the cities in North Africa Djelfa is the
most lamentable. There is nothing to redeem its dull squalor, not
even a possible climate. In winter it freezes; in summer the heat
is unbearable; in the spring an icy blast blows from the mountains;
in autumn it rains and snows.</p>

<p>It would be the test of affection between a man and a woman to
pass six months in this place and remain on speaking terms. If the
traveler is wise he has lunched on the broad plain before reaching
this wretched town, as, if not, he must suffer a meal in the very
tumble-down hotel, which does its best, but which fails from want
of support. Djelfa must be left as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The car turns to the south, passes through another fortified
gateway, and is soon speeding away on the straight white road which
leads to the Sahara.</p>

<p>More alfa, more bare hills, more broad horizons. At the
fifteenth kilometer the <i>col des caravanes</i>, the highest point
on the road, is reached, and, away, away, the road can be seen like
a long ribbon unrolling itself toward the blue skies of the great
south.</p>

<p>The caravanserai of Aïn el Ibel, the Spring of the Camels, is
the next landmark; once the nightly lodging in the days of the
diligence, it is now only used as a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_185">[185]</span> place to drink coffee if one is frequenting
the public car. The country is very lonely and desolate. It is a
land of sheep-breeding, and, though the traveler coming straight
from the green fields of Europe looks doubtfully at the gray scrub
about him, he will have his doubts removed when he sees the great
flocks feeding peacefully on either side of the road.</p>

<p>Calm-faced nomads, tall of stature, watch over them, and in the
distance a few black patches indicate where the camp has been
temporarily pitched. Camels too are everywhere, and have replaced
all forms of more modern transport. Caravans of these ungainly
beasts, bearing bales of wool and alfa, with here and there the
<i>bassours</i> in which the women travel, plod slowly along.</p>

<p>There is a sensation of something new in the atmosphere—the
people of the north have been left far behind, and at every
revolution of the wheels one seems to be speeding into the past.
The flocks, the camels, the tents, the tall shepherds are the same
as they were twelve hundred years ago, and even the rumbling
motor-lorry which keeps the south supplied with sugar and coffee
does not affect them.</p>

<p>A few palm-trees appear, growing about a white caravanserai,
while mud houses cluster in a dip. It is the miniature oasis of
Sidi Maklouf. The road turns sharply to the right, runs down into a
dried-up river-bed, and then stretches straight away to the south.
The barren hill on the right looks like the edge of a saw; ahead
there is a distant horizon in a haze of blue; the eyes would like
to be there and see what is beyond.</p>

<p>Again the road bends, this time to the left, a dark mass
appears, which, gradually getting more distinct, reveals itself as
trees—palm-trees in thousands. Rosy rocks break the horizon, a
white column leaps to the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_186">[186]</span> sky; it is the minaret of Laghouat. The car
passes through the sandy bed of a broad river, usually a trickling
stream, but sometimes in the autumn a roaring torrent, making
access to the oasis impossible. The road slips through plantations
of tamarisk, and in a few moments an avenue of plane-trees is
entered.</p>

<p>Gardens and quiet little villas are on either side, until,
reaching the fortified walls, the car draws up before the
Transatlantic Hotel, nestling picturesquely amid the tall palms.
There is an atmosphere of peace and quiet, and a welcome which is
pleasant after the long journey.</p>

<p>The interior of the hotel does not belie the exterior, and, when
one realizes that it was once the <i>bash agha’s</i> Turkish bath,
the charm of the surroundings is complete.</p>

<p>An English tea awaits one, and when it has been consumed let the
traveler climb to the rosy rock near by and get his first glimpse
of the Sahara. If it is a clear evening the sunset effect will be a
vision never to be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br>
<span class="sc2">THE OASIS OF LAGHOUAT</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> first view of the Sahara is perhaps
one of the most amazing things in the world. The northern part of
the oasis is divided from the southern by a barrier of rocks, and,
as one tops the cliff, a sense of awe fills one as one contemplates
the immensity of the vision spread out. The mind, unaccustomed to
such spectacles, rushes back and tries to compare the scene with
anything it has ever seen before, but it fails hopelessly, and
remains in wonderment before this wide panorama. And yet, as one
gazes at the plain—which seems to roll out from the sand in the
foreground to an endless expanse of stones, until it merges into
the sky and is lost in an infinite horizon—one can not help being
reminded of the sea on a calm evening: the oasis is some tropical
island, with its palm-trees growing almost down to the water’s
edge; the golden sand lapped by this tideless ocean, and then the
sea—away, away, far away—until the next island.</p>

<p>“Island” is really the only descriptive word for an oasis in its
ocean of desolation. It suddenly springs up and suddenly
disappears. Unless the water changes its course, nothing human can
cause a tree to grow outside its perimeter, any more than anything
could be raised out of the sea.</p>

<p>Laghouat is a very typical oasis of the south. From the rocky
eminence can be seen the town, clustering on either side of the
rocky barrier; the mosque on an eminence in the center, modern and
rather gaudy, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
not unpleasant to look at; the very unprepossessing Catholic
church, rather like a wedding cake; and the two oases, north and
south. The town itself is comparatively modern, having been rebuilt
on the site of the old city which was utterly destroyed by the
French in 1852 to punish its heroic defenders for having held out
so long against them.</p>

<p>There are two versions as to the origin of the name Laghouat.
The first suggestion is from the Arab word <i>“gaouth,”</i> or more
exactly <i>“rouat,”</i> meaning a house in a dip with a garden, and
which has been contracted into “El aghouat.” The second is
“El-aghouat,” of which the derivation is <i>a mountain the ridge of
which resembles the teeth of a saw</i>. Both are plausible
suggestions, as all the houses have gardens, and the mountains in
the neighborhood give one very much the impression of saws.</p>

<p>Prior to the eighteenth century there is very little information
to be had concerning Laghouat. It was evidently an oasis frequented
by nomads, but there does not appear to have been any definite
settlement. In 1700, however, Sidi-El-Hadj-Aïssa, a very saintly
<i>marabout</i>, collected the tribes of the district about him and
made it clear that it would be in their interest to group
themselves in one body, and it must have been at this time that the
present Confederation of the Larbas came into existence.</p>

<p>Sidi-El-Hadj-Aïssa, who is the patron of the oasis, is a figure
of great importance in the Moslem history of Algeria, and he is
venerated throughout the country, more especially as a prophet.
Concerning the truth of his foresight it is not for us to
criticize, but the facts are worth noting. It appears that after
creating this center and making of the divided nomads one people,
they did not show the desired gratitude, and as punishment the
<i>marabout</i> laid a terrible curse<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_189">[189]</span> on his followers. In the curse he
prophesied the downfall of the city, internal war, and the French
invasion. And, though it is too long to go into, it is curious to
note that all the details of the prophecy occurred.</p>

<p>He made a further prophecy which is kept a great secret, to the
effect that Algeria would be delivered by a great chief who would
rise in Morocco and finally become Khalifat of North Africa.</p>

<p>I leave it to the reader to draw his own conclusions, but the
fact remains that the French did invade Algeria, and that events in
Morocco seemed at one time to indicate a fulfilment of his
words.</p>

<p>The town reconstructed on the site of the old city may be more
solid, but it could not be less beautiful. Straight streets running
at right-angles, plain and drab—it is the typical architecture of
the modern southern town. There is a certain picturesque atmosphere
in the quarter bordering on the southern oasis, but it is very poor
and dirty.</p>

<p>The people live in small houses, and ply their business quite
humbly. Modernisms have not crept in, and the shopkeepers do not
worry the visitor to buy. When the day’s work is over they repair
to their gardens—the gardens which have made Laghouat famous. Every
man who can afford it has his own piece of land in the oasis. It
may be an acre, it may be three, but, all the same, it is his
garden and he is proud of it. Surrounded by high walls, it is
planted with palm-trees, peach-trees, vines, apricots, figs,
oranges, pomegranates, pears, medlars, and, in fact, all kinds of
fruit.</p>

<p>The oasis being at a comparatively high level, the date-palms do
not produce a very marketable fruit, such as is found at Biskra in
the south, and in Laghouat a palm-tree only brings in fifty francs.
All the other fruit-trees, however, bear abundantly,
too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span> abundantly,
for, there being no railway, there is no outlet, and in early
summer peaches can be had for one franc the dozen, and apricots are
given away. Some people even find it too much trouble to carry the
fruit to market, and they merely eat what they can and use the rest
for manure.</p>

<p>Vegetables are in almost the same position, and are sold for
negligible sums. It is astonishing to realize that such fertility
exists so close to the wastes of the desert. There is a wonderful
opportunity for an enterprising man with capital who comes to
Laghouat with a fleet of lorries and bears away the fruit and
vegetables to Algiers. The purchase of the raw material will cost
him next to nothing; it is merely a question of transport. A jam
factory in Laghouat would pay a hundred per cent., but let it be
hoped, for the sake of the peace and beauty of the surroundings,
that no enterprising capitalist will come and spoil a land of pure
delight, where living is so easy and so cheap.</p>

<p>To produce all this vegetation, however, there must be water,
and, its absence being conspicuous in the south, it may interest
the reader to hear how an oasis is watered.</p>

<p>The whole of southern Algeria is crossed by rivers, which in the
winter have a certain amount of water, but which in the summer are
dry, and are in reality only drains to carry off the rain which
comes down from the hills after storms.</p>

<p>The real rivers of the south follow the water-courses, but they
flow underground, and it is only when they rise to the surface that
they form an oasis, and, as the Arabs say, the palm-trees spring up
with their feet in the water and their heads in the flames.
Anywhere along these courses wells can be sunk and the water tapped
at a depth varying from one hundred and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_191">[191]</span> twenty to twelve hundred feet, and in some
cases there are broad underground lakes, known to the natives as
Behar Tahtani—<i>the sea of the underworld</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Wherever, therefore, the river rises to the surface and forms an
oasis the land becomes very rich, and all vegetation is of the most
luxuriant. Sand mixed with irrigated earth is excessively fertile,
and produces everything from roses and strawberries to jasmine and
lemons. Cereals would thrive and cover endless acres if there was
enough water. Water—that is the question of daily life in the great
south. You may cross endless wastes of desertic plain with only a
few tufts of alfa grass here and there, and suddenly come upon a
great oasis, green and fresh in the watered land. But it ends as
abruptly as it began, and, although you may find yourself standing
in a garden of flowers and fruits and green grass, two hundred
yards away is the blasted desolation of the Sahara.</p>

<p>The distribution of water, therefore, is done very methodically.
There is, of course, the underground layer, in which rest the roots
of the palms, but the surface water for the lesser vegetables is
another matter. There is always a point where the water actually
comes to the surface in the form of springs, and, of course, the
river-bed which, during the winter rains, is running with water,
sometimes after big storms is a raging torrent overflowing the
land.</p>

<p>The water is, therefore, captured at these points and carried
into the oasis by means of channels called <i>seguias</i>, so
inclined that the water is always flowing round the gardens. The
oasis is, moreover, divided into areas, and the areas receive the
water at regular intervals. A garden has so many minutes, according
to its size, and it is calculated that the whole surface under
cultivation is flooded for its appointed period once every seven
days. The system is ingeniously<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_192">[192]</span> worked by sluices, padlocked by the water
controller of the area, who, when the appointed day occurs, lets in
the water, while the owner of the domain diverts it into the
necessary quarters on his own land, according to its need. At the
end of the appointed time the controller closes the sluice-gates
and floods the next garden. Rain is considered as an extra, and
whatever the weather the water-day is continued.</p>

<p>Apart from gardening, which is the hobby of all good Laghouatis,
there are other industries. Carpet-making and weaving, the
occupation of the women of the south, is very important here, and
some of the best burnouses and other woolen goods originate in
Laghouat; and, of course, there is sheep-breeding; this is the
great occupation in the northern Sahara, and a source of
substantial revenue.</p>

<p>Some of the Jews are goldsmiths; they are also cobblers, and
they embroider leather to make into bags and saddles.</p>

<p>A walk in the evening in the dancing-girls’ quarter will remove
all the theatrical atmosphere which the same thing in Bou Saada has
created. The streets and coffee-houses are thronged nightly summer
and winter alike; the squeal of the <i>raïta</i> and the beat of
the <i>tam-tam</i> never cease, and if one strolls in and sits down
on a bench the performance will not change because of the entrance
of the tourist. The women continue dancing slowly up and down the
middle of the room, while the men sit in serried ranks and stare,
sipping their coffee or mint tea. There is no charge except for the
cup of harmless beverage which costs five sous. Sometimes a
dancing-girl will hold out her hand, and will be delighted with a
packet of cigarettes or a franc, and occasionally the band makes a
collection, but there is none of that grasping rush to exploit
tourists associated with those more popular centers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
</p>

<p>There is little else to describe in the oasis, as the atmosphere
of the past is impossible to realize for those who live in great
cities. The lack of traffic, the blueness of the sky, the tall,
feathery palms, the dignity of the Arabs, the silence—especially
the silence—are things which must be seen and felt to be
appreciated.</p>

<p>It is a setting of peace, an atmosphere of calm—a solution to
the worries of modern life.</p>

<h2><a id="c29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br>
<span class="sc2">THE MZAB</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> journey south to Ghardaïa is very
desolate; even the tufts of alfa have practically disappeared. The
road runs straight across the flat plain, with nothing to relieve
the eye except occasional groups of dreary trees known as
<i>pistachiers</i>. Flocks of sheep graze by the roadside. The
nomads’ tents stand out like black patches on the stony ground.
Sometimes a herd of gazelles will be seen in the distance, bustards
rise and flap languidly away, hares abound. It is a great country
for hawking.</p>

<p>If the day is hot, mirages will spring up and disappear as
quickly. It is not a picturesque journey to the land of the Mzab.
Half-way, the caravanserai of Tilrempt is reached; it is a long
white building standing in a dip surrounded by <i>pistachiers</i>.
A very worthy “mine host” will greet the traveler and regale him in
this desert home with one of the best meals he will taste in
Algeria.</p>

<p>A visitors’ book will be presented to him, with which he can
regale himself joyously for half an hour before committing himself
to the pages as a further joy to those who follow. After Tilrempt
the country becomes more and more desertic, even the alfa has
completely vanished—only rough scrub, and little of that. Then
suddenly, at the one hundred and fiftieth kilometer, the oasis of
Berriane appears, a splash of vivid green in the middle of the
wilderness. The sensation of the verdure, after miles of desert, is
most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> refreshing.
Berriane is the first city of the Mzab, and one is at once struck
by the originality of the architecture, quite unlike anything that
has been seen up till now. The minaret of the mosque reminds one of
an obelisk.</p>

<p>But this haven of green is soon left behind, and more desolation
begins. Not even the scrub, only stones and rocks and strips of
sand. It is a merciless, arid desert, the kind of scene which must
have inspired Doré to illustrate the Inferno of Dante: nothing to
relieve the eye for miles around.</p>

<p>Ghardaïa is reached unexpectedly. One appears to be in the
middle of the desert, when all of a sudden the road turns sharply
to the right and dips down a steep hill. It is as if one were
descending into the crater of a volcano. As the car reaches the
flat there suddenly appears the cone-like minaret of Ghardaïa, as
it piles itself into a kind of heap of houses on a little hill. To
the left is the equally heap-like city of Melika. It is an
impression never to be forgotten, a new world quite unlike anything
seen before. But then the people of the Mzab are a race of their
own, and the confederation of cities is quite unique. The Mzab is
the Mzab, and it can be compared to nothing— it is the most
original place in North Africa.</p>

<p>The first question to decide, however, before penetrating into
its desolation and studying the inhabitants, is, <i>Who are these
people?</i> And, curiously enough, the question is not easy to
answer. It is obvious to the simplest minded, on seeing these
small, squat men—with their smooth, round, white faces, fringed
with dark beards—that they are unlike any one else seen in
Algeria.</p>

<p>They are as different as the Spaniards from the Germans, as the
British from the Italians. There are various theories put forward,
of which the most picturesque<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_196">[196]</span> can not really be said to be founded on any
sound basis: it is that these strange people are the lost tribe of
Israel. In support of this theory we have the mystery of their
origin, and their very Semitic appearance; but, though it would be
pleasant to write a romance on the subject, it would certainly have
little merit outside fiction.</p>

<p>The second suggestion is that they are the direct descendants of
the old Phœnicians. People who oppose this idea bring forward the
fact that when Scipio destroyed Carthage he killed or deported all
the inhabitants. Against this, however, it must be evident that
there were Carthaginians in other parts of North Africa who escaped
this fate, and that Phœnician influence is found at a much later
date.</p>

<p>In the Mzab itself there are certainly things very closely
connected with Carthage. The triangular decoration of the houses,
the pictures of fish, of the crescent moon, of the sun and the
stars are not Arab. The door-knockers represent the sun, and there
are many of phallic shape. But, in spite of these rather conclusive
evidences, the general idea is that the people of the Mzab are pure
Berbers. In support of this theory we have the fact that they are
Abhadites—that is to say, the last group of people created by the
great Kharedjite schism. What is certain is that the known groups
of Abhadites at Oman, Zanzibar, Djebel Nefarsa and the island of
Djerba have the same customs and language as the people of
Ghardaïa.</p>

<p>The question then arises, why are these people in this
desolation of the Sahara, on no natural highway, and in no trade
center, where all the water comes from wells dug by the
inhabitants, where it rains about once every ten years? Why have
these men voluntarily condemned themselves to this life of trial
and struggle? Those learned on the subject maintain
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> this exile was
conceived in a moment of despair and as an act of faith, that in
settling themselves in this merciless desert they wished once and
for all to flee from the persecution which was always meted out to
them by the orthodox Mohammedans, and keep their form of religion
and race intact.</p>

<p>It seems difficult to contradict this theory, all the more so
when we have evidence that they were driven from the Atlantic coast
and Tiaret in Oranie to Ouargla, an oasis some two hundred
kilometers south of Ghardaïa, and that, after barely two hundred
years in this oasis, they were again driven out by the Arabs.
Weary, therefore, of suffering, they determined to settle where no
one would come and molest them, and, as the only solution was to
find a place naturally hostile to invaders, they chose the Mzab.
This took place about <span class="sc2">A. D.</span> 1070, but
already in the year 1000 a reconnaissance had been made in the
direction of the Mzab and had founded a kind of refuge at El Ateuf.
When, therefore, the general emigration north took place, the
remaining six cities which form the confederation of the Mzab soon
sprang up—Bou, Noura, Melika, and Beni Sgen about <span class=
"sc2">A. D.</span> 1048; Ghardaïa 1053; and some hundred years
later Guerrera and Berriane, thirty miles outside the group
adjacent to Ghardaïa.</p>

<p>Unlike most oases of the south, where water comes gushing out of
the ground and is directed by artificial channels to irrigate the
gardens, there was no surface water at all on the site chosen by
these people to found their cities. Every palm-tree planted, every
seed sown had to be watered artificially from wells, and if one
looks at the broad oasis, with its thousands of palm-trees, and
when one realizes that when the Mzabites first came the land was as
barren as that seen from the road, the feat performed leaves one
amazed.</p>

<p>The system of drawing water has, moreover, not<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span> changed since those days. The
well is sunk and a kind of tank is built beside it, with channels
leading out to the parts of the land to be irrigated. A sloping
path is constructed, down which walks a camel with a rope tied to
its neck, while at the other end of the rope is a skin resting at
the water-level. When the camel gets to the end of his walk the
skin reaches the surface and by an ingenious contrivance pours its
contents into the tank; the camel returns to the well, thus
lowering the skin to the water again, and the process recommences.
The creaking sound of the pulley drawing up the skin has a certain
curious charm reminding one of Egypt.</p>

<p>Occasionally, but very occasionally, the rain comes, and to meet
this possibility barrages have been made across every little valley
in order to form small lakes. Beside every path or rock, gutters
have been constructed leading to one center where the water can be
stored. A rain-storm in the Mzab is worth untold millions to its
inhabitants.</p>

<p>And yet the Mzabite is not a farmer in any sense of the word,
and unless he is himself forced through poverty to work in the
garden he will avoid all contact with the soil and employ Arabs to
look after the land. He is essentially a merchant, living in his
shop and opposed to all outdoor life, all sport or anything
military. This antipathy to war again raises the question as to
whether he is really pure Berber. His cousins the Touaregs, the men
of the Aurès and the Kabyle Mountains, the people of the Riff, are
all born warriors. Why, then, has the Mzabite never been able to
defend himself?</p>

<p>To my mind it confirms the theory that originally he was a
Carthaginian who became Berberized. Moreover, his round, squat
appearance is much more that which one would associate with the
prosperous trader<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
of Carthage than with the wild men of the Riff. All their instincts
are for business. One sees these fat little men plying their trade
in Algiers, in the towns of the Tell, living humbly and simply
until the day is ripe to return to the Mzab. For return they must,
and this because no woman is ever allowed to leave the
confederation of the seven towns, and, as no Mzabite may marry an
Arab or vice versa, he is obliged to go back to his home to
continue the family. The family to him is of the highest
importance, and though they are, generally speaking, a democratic
race, they are very proud of their lineage, and their aristocracy
holds an important position.</p>

<p>Their habits are decidedly conservative, and are very noticeable
in the strictness with which their women are kept. They do not go
to market, and it is very rare to see one in the street. The
children are terribly shy, and at the approach of a stranger they
flee and at once hide in the houses.</p>

<p>They observe their religion most conscientiously; as it is the
Abhadite dissension it is very strict, and it is carried out to the
last letter, and, whereas one finds a good many Arabs breaking the
laws of the Prophet as it concerns wines and spirits, it is
excessively rare to see a Mzabite drink.</p>

<p>Their mosques are much more respected than those of the orthodox
Mohammedan; no one can be buried in them, and they are sanctuary to
all criminals. Their cemeteries are venerated, and one sees on the
tombs pots and plates, offerings to the dead, which again carries
one back to a more subtle origin than that of the ordinary Berber.
They sacrifice camels and oxen and sheep at appointed times,
chiefly for the purpose of bringing down rain, but also for more
daily occurrences, such as the laying of a foundation-stone.</p>

<p>As stated above, their commercial instincts are<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span> extraordinary, and it is said
that Ghardaïa and the adjacent towns conceal millions of gold
pieces. It is certain that in 1921, the year of the great famine,
these people had enough money to buy all they needed, and they did
not suffer half as much as the other tribes of the south.</p>

<p>They keep themselves very much apart from all other people, and
they consider the Mzab as a holy corner of the earth. The Arabs who
live in this wilderness are kept quite separate, with a quarter and
a mosque of their own, and, while mutually despising one another,
are usually the servants of the Mzabites. The Jews likewise who are
found in Ghardaïa itself, not only have a reserved quarter of the
town but they also wear a peculiar dress, and are treated with the
utmost contempt. In fact, in all ways the people of the Mzab are
quite different from any other race in North Africa, and the study
of their history and customs would give material for a lengthy
book. It is hoped, however, that these few pages will enable the
traveler to realize that he is no longer among the simple Arabs of
the great plain, but in the midst of a strange people whose origin
will always remain a mystery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c30"></a>CHAPTER XXX<br>
<span class="sc2">GHARDAIA AND ADJOINING TOWNS</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">During</span> the journey south we have passed
Berriane, the outpost of the Mzab, and of later foundation than the
other towns. Guerrera is on the journey to Touggourt; the remaining
five towns of the confederation are before us in this kind of
desolate rock crater. The most important and the largest of them is
Ghardaïa, lying at the foot of the military <i>bordj</i>, where it
is necessary to pass the night. On a rocky eminence to the east is
Melika, further on, the holy city of Beni Sgen, and out of sight,
but only a few miles distant, are Bou Noura and El Ateuf.</p>

<p>To the south again there is another oasis called Metlili, which
some people erroneously comprise in the confederation of the Mzab,
but though in many ways it has Mzabite characteristics it is in
reality a town of the tribe of the Chambas, nomads who inhabit a
vast area of the Sahara beyond Ghardaïa.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes one as one looks at Ghardaïa is the
way the houses pile themselves up into a heap, rather like a giant
ant-hill which is, in its turn, surmounted by the minaret made of
mud, resembling an obelisk with little holes in the top. Moreover,
if we turn and look at Melika and Beni Sgen we are struck by the
same similarity of construction which we saw at Berriane and which
we shall see in all the towns of the Mzab.</p>

<p>The origin of these cones is easy to find. As each town was
founded, the group of elders whose duty<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_202">[202]</span> it was to carry out this rite first of all
built the mosque on a hilltop; this mosque was at the same time a
store for food and arms as well as a fortress. Consequently the
people grouped themselves on the slopes beneath. This again is
evidence of the great antiquity of the race, for is it not known
that all early religious orders frequented heights and that
nowadays theosophists refer a great deal to the influence of high
places on their mysticism? The effect is very curious, and even if
the aspect of the people does not create an impression, their
architecture surely will. Descending from the eminence on which is
situated the <i>bordj</i>, a narrow street will be followed, which
suddenly leads out into a broad square, surrounded by unsymmetrical
arcades. If the <i>caïd</i> is at home he will probably permit the
visitor to mount to his roof and look down on this animated center
and up toward the tall minaret. In the middle of the square is a
kind of stone stage where, on certain days, justice is
administered, while close by will be seen a curious group of stones
set out in a horseshoe formation. This strange circle marks the
site where the elders of the city first sat down in the open plain
a thousand years ago to found Ghardaïa.</p>

<p>Leaving the square, the route to take is up a narrow street
leading direct to the mosque. The houses almost meet, and in
certain places the alley is tunneled through the habitations. A
narrow passage leads up to the mosque, and if one has a competent
guide a dark chamber can be visited which is a place of ablution,
but which, in days gone by, was the scene of political
conspiracies. The mosque itself is quite unlike anything one has
seen before. The pillars are neither Turkish nor Roman, the
architecture has no sort of connection with any known style. In the
wall are holes to place shoes before going into the sanctuary to
pray; hanging from the roof is a skin full<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_203">[203]</span> of water, the greatest sign of charity in
this country where water is more valuable than gold.</p>

<p>Above, a kind of cage covered in with wire netting, reminding
one of a chicken-run or rabbit-hutch, leaves one wondering. A
hundred guesses will not elucidate the mystery—it is the
lost-property office!</p>

<p>Climbing on to the roof, a panoramic view of the town spreads
itself below. To the east the Jewish quarter, with a curious
pyramid-like synagogue; to the west the Arab quarter, with an
insignificant mosque; to the south the more modern buildings, with
the house of the White Fathers, while away in the distance can be
seen the beginning of the great oasis, brilliant green against the
barren hills.</p>

<p>If one is lucky one may see from here the strange sight of a man
selling his house. There he stands on the roof while the would-be
purchasers squat round making bids.</p>

<p>The walk can be continued through the narrow streets past wells
three hundred feet deep with the eternal skin dangling at the end
of a long rope. A visit is recommended to the Convent of the White
Sisters, who teach the little girls to weave carpets in the
patterns peculiar to the country, and if souvenirs are wanted it is
advised to buy them here. Likewise at the house of the White
Fathers leather goods of the country can also be had at moderate
prices.</p>

<p>Returning toward the fort a series of cemeteries will be passed,
as well as a broad open space, where on special occasions the
public prayer takes place. A morning will suffice for Ghardaïa, and
the afternoon can be devoted to the other cities.</p>

<p>The most interesting place to see is the holy city of Beni Sgen
and its oasis, but as this will not take the whole afternoon part
of the time can be devoted to Melika, Bou Noura or El Ateuf. I
would suggest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span> Bou
Noura. Melika involves a very steep climb up a cliff and El Ateuf a
motor drive over a very bad road. Moreover, all these cities are
much alike. What strikes one most is their poverty in comparison
with Ghardaïa; all the rich merchants are there, and even the
inhabitants of the other towns come to the capital to do
business.</p>

<p>After visiting Bou Noura, therefore, a walk can be taken in the
oasis behind Beni Sgen. A wide area of verdure relieves the eye,
and though the palm-trees are squat like the inhabitants, it is a
very refreshing place. There is a barrage of brick drawn right
across the oasis to catch any stray water which some unforeseen
storm may bring. Here the wells and the method of working them may
be seen at close quarters.</p>

<p>Beni Sgen should be reached about the middle of the afternoon,
and this for a reason to be explained later. Of all the curious
towns in this strange country the holy city is the most curious. It
is entirely walled in, with three gates piercing the walls at the
north, the east, and the west. No Arab, Christian or Jew is
permitted to linger within its keep after sunset; no smoking is
allowed in the houses nor in the streets; even the French school is
built outside the wall. At the entrance of the northern gate the
skin of water hangs in sign of charity.</p>

<p>Climbing up a steep alley one comes to a tower; the key is
usually available, and, entering, one can ascend the winding steps
which lead one successively to three stories which at one time were
guardrooms. From the summit one obtains a magnificent view of the
town itself as well as of the oases of Ghardaïa, Melika and Bou
Noura. Immediately below the tower is a little cemetery where one
will note the offerings to the dead in the shape of plates and
jars. To the east are two broad platforms for the public
prayer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
</p>

<p>As the afternoon draws on, flocks of goats can be seen wandering
slowly in from the barren hills. They have a public shepherd, paid
for by the town, who is responsible for the animals up to the gate
of the city; at this point he leaves them and the goats, separating
themselves, go independently up the narrow streets to their
respective homes. When they reach the door they butt it with their
heads or tap with their hoofs until they are let in.</p>

<p>The doors of the houses in the Mzab, and especially the locks,
are very curious. The door itself is usually made of heavy planks
studded with nails and closed with a lock usually associated with a
prison gate. This, however, is a modern institution, for the native
key is unique in the world. It consists of a piece of wood about a
foot long, at the end of which is arranged a pattern of nails. This
piece of wood is pushed into a kind of deep slot running from the
doorpost diagonally toward the door. From the wall and running into
the door is a wooden bar or bolt on which is a pattern of nails
corresponding to those on the wooden key. The proprietor slips in
his piece of wood until its nails coincide with those inside and
then he pulls, the bar gives and it is possible to open the door.
It is, I suppose, the origin of the latch-key, as no two
combinations of nails are the same, and it means absolute safety to
the designer of the piece of wood.</p>

<p>At each turn the traveler is experiencing something new, and
though he has seen a series of strange customs common to all the
cities of the Mzab, the most curious, which is peculiar only to
Beni Sgen, has been left to the last. For some reason, which at
present it has been impossible to fathom, there are practically no
shops in the holy city, and everything is sold by auction. This
sounds quite incredible until, climbing down the steep streets, one
comes suddenly into a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_206">[206]</span> triangular “square” about fifty yards long.
At one end on a raised platform sits the <i>caïd</i>, surrounded by
his counselors, while all around squat men of venerable countenance
dressed in white robes.</p>

<p>In the middle of the square are a few goats, some camels, a
mule, a heap of charcoal, while the auctioneers solemnly carry
round the goods to be disposed of, stopping before each person to
hear his bid, which is said in a whisper. So he proceeds round and
round until the required price is attained. He may be selling a
costly carpet or a bottle of pickles, a piece of firewood or some
embroidered shoes—it is all the same. The goods can pass only to
the highest bidder. Moreover, as the price can only be raised half
a franc at a time it often takes days to acquire the object
required. Sometimes one sees a man riding round the square on a
mule or a donkey which he wishes to dispose of, but it is all the
same, and the richest Mzabite can not alter the procedure for
untold cash. The spectacle of this auction market is one of the
most impressive sights in all North Africa. An atmosphere of an old
world, long past and forgotten, is before us, and as one looks at
the faces of the men one can not help being reminded of scenes from
the Bible, and the legend of the lost tribe springs up
unconsciously.</p>

<p>The colored burnous of the Arab has vanished, the bustling
merchant of Ghardaïa is no longer before us, there is calmness of
demeanor, a whiteness of clothing which speaks of ages and ages in
the dim realm of history when Europe was a land of wild beasts and
the Britons painted themselves blue.</p>

<p>At times one is almost inclined to cry out:</p>

<p>“But this can’t be real, this is got up for me, it is part of
Wembley; in an hour all these men will be settling down to chops
and beer in the nearest pub!”</p>

<p>But it is not so. Every day, except on great feasts,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span> year in and year out, for two
hours before sunset these silent old gentlemen assemble before the
<i>caïd</i> and purchase what they can by auction, and when it is
over they repair to the mosque before retiring to their homes to
eat a silent meal prior to returning to bed. The Mzabite is not a
gay personality, and he takes life very seriously. Unfortunately
some of their more ancient characteristics have disappeared by the
appointment of civil <i>caïds</i>. In the early days of the French
conquest of Algeria these people surrendered to the invader before
they had even thought of pushing as far as the Mzab, and they still
have a separate treaty with France, making of the country a sort of
independent little republic exempt from all obligations to the main
Government. They kept all their religious dignitaries who ruled the
whole confederation as they had done for centuries before, and the
<i>caïd</i>-ship was not imposed on the tribe till after the whole
of Algeria had been pacified. Lately the French seem to have rather
forgotten their old friends and have voted conscription. This
caused great consternation until it was discovered that there was a
subparagraph permitting a Mzabite to send an Arab in his place to
serve. The authority to spend a thousand francs to find some poor
loon to shoulder the rifle brought back the smiles to the smooth,
round, white faces, and the placid atmosphere returned to the busy
shops of Ghardaïa and to the silent streets of the holy city.</p>

<p>Generally speaking nothing has changed since the foundation of
the cities, and even if in some far-off day the railway reaches the
Mzab it will probably only have the effect of stimulating trade.
The haunt of the children of Carthage will remain as it was when
their forefathers imposed their commerce on the whole of the
Mediterranean basin as they are now beginning to impose it on the
easy-going Arabs of North Africa.</p>

</p>

<h2><a id="c31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI<br>
<span class="sc2">GUERRERA AND THE SAND DESERT</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">To cross</span> over from the rock desert of
the Mzab to the sand of Touggourt it is advisable to be very
certain of the reliability of the car, and, if possible, to go
accompanied by another vehicle. The country to be traversed is
terribly desolate, and, except when the mail bus runs, once a week,
it is very seldom that one meets any traffic; if one has a serious
breakdown one must wait in the desert for the passage of the
<i>diligence</i>, which may be some days.</p>

<p>Water—plenty of water—and some food should be carried, a rope
and a spade to help one out of the sand, and all necessary spare
parts.</p>

<p>The road on leaving Ghardaïa is the same by which one arrives,
but, after following it for ten kilometers, one turns sharply to
the right along the desert track. There is at once an impression of
desolation and loneliness—no more telegraph poles, no more
milestones, little to mark the sides of the road. At first the
flat-topped hills are on either side, then gradually they give way
to great rolling expanses stretching away, away on all sides; even
the scrub has disappeared; it is the first real impression of the
Sahara, and, though the noisy rush of the car makes one forget the
solitude, the silence and loneliness appal one at any stop one
makes.</p>

<p>Some twenty kilometers along the track another track branches
off to the right. It must not be taken, as it leads to Ouargla, to
the Hoggar, to the far south<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_209">[209]</span> until it reaches Timbuctou. A little
farther on, as if nature wished to fool the traveler, one suddenly
sees a splash of green winding about among the stony plain. It
looks like some lovely river shaded by trees, and, though there is
no water running between its banks, it is a river making its way
below the surface of the ground, to spring up later at some oasis.
But it is soon left behind, and the country becomes more and more
desertic, though, curiously enough, it has not such a cruel aspect
as the land about Ghardaïa. The hills are of a delicate rose color
and the lines less hard; it is the prelude to the sand.</p>

<p>The road starts climbing, then all of a sudden, as it tops the
rise, the oasis of Guerrera appears, solitary in the middle of
these pink hills. It is the most impressive sight of the whole
journey. Battlemented walls surround the town, as it piles itself
into a pinnacle surmounted by the cone-like minaret. At its feet
lies the oasis, with its thirty thousand palm-trees bowing in the
breeze. It is one of the most amazing spectacles any traveler can
wish to see—an impression of desolation, of solitude, of green
vegetation, of a town of a past age.</p>

<p>There is quite comfortable accommodation in the <i>bordj</i>,
and, though the food is almost entirely Arab, it is cleanly cooked.
In the itinerary set out at the end of Chapter XXV it has been
suggested that Guerrera should be passed through on the way to
Touggourt, without stopping, but, though it differs little from the
other six towns of the Mzab, its oasis, its remoteness from
civilization, make it well worth a longer break in the journey.</p>

<p>On entering the town by one of the turreted gates, one is first
of all struck by the business and bustle of the people. Arriving
here out of the desolation of the Sahara, one almost expects to see
savages or, at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
rate, dark people living in a primitive state, but not at all; the
houses are solidly built and are clean and well-kept; the people
are gracefully robed in white, shops abound, and practically every
one speaks a little French. It is the civilization, the business
instinct of the Mzabite, the inherited perseverance of the
Carthaginian which permits these squat little people to thrive in
this lost city of the Sahara.</p>

<p>But the most beautiful place is the oasis. Unlike those we have
seen before, there are none of those high walls which screen the
gardens and which prevent our seeing anything behind them. Here
there are no walls, the palm-trees grow all about, with vegetables
and grass at their feet; vines are trained from stem to stem, and
give an impression of virgin forest. Little paths and sun-baked
alleys lead one past wells and fruit-trees until, coming suddenly
out of the shade, one finds oneself on the desert again. A small
group of palm-trees cuts the horizon, and then, away, away, the
Sahara as far as the eye can reach. The sun sets in an orange
radiance, wrapping the palm-trees in a mantle of gold-dust; the
breeze springs up and rustles through the oasis; peace and silence
are everywhere, and one is tempted to remain in this quiet for a
few days. It is free to the traveler to do as he pleases, but our
journey must be accomplished, and sooner or later we must push on
toward the east.</p>

<p>After Guerrera the road continues across this rose-colored
landscape. It is impossible to describe it adequately, photographs
do not give the impression of delicate color or of the limitless
horizon, neither can the mind of him who has not been in the real
Sahara visualize the vast expanse of sky which seems to cover the
world.</p>

<p>Some fifty kilometers before reaching Touggourt one comes into
the sand. It is an impression as different<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_211">[211]</span> as possible from anything which has been
passed up to the present. Soft white dunes rise up before one,
curling back and looking like great waves of the Atlantic about to
break into foam. In all directions this sea extends without any
sort of break, and one realizes a little what it must be to lose
one’s way in a desert where there is nothing to guide one, nothing
to differentiate one dune from another.</p>

<p>If the wind is not blowing, it is a pleasant drive through this
area of sand, but if it is, the drifting grit blinds, gets into the
engine, and covers the track, and it is practically certain that
sooner or later the car will stick and that it will take infinite
trouble to free it.</p>

<p>Touggourt itself is a typical southern town, of little interest
beyond its situation in the sand; moreover, it has lost a good deal
of its charm by the presence of the railway and the consequent
invasion of tourists. Hotels have sprung up, and the streets are
infested by guides. It is one of the great date centers of Algeria,
and the sweet luscious fruit eaten in England at Christmas-time
comes from the one hundred and seventy thousand palm-trees which
form its lovely oasis. If one is here in November one can see the
Arabs swarming up the trees in a miraculous fashion and cutting off
the bunches of golden dates, which are let down to earth by means
of a rope slung over one of the branches.</p>

<p>In March and April one will see a still more curious sight, the
fertilization of the palm. The flower of the male tree is carried
to the top of the female by an Arab who places it in a cleft in the
head of the tree while he chants religious airs. A date-palm does
not bear fruit for twelve years, but when it does it goes on for
over a hundred, and those who own palmeries in the areas which
produce the right kind of fruit are excessively rich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
</p>

<p>One night will suffice to see Touggourt, and the sunset over the
sand-dunes is a spectacle never to be forgotten, while if a caravan
from the south arrives it affords a wonderful impression of a
period of the past. It is hard to realize that in this sandy
country the only really adequate mode of transport is the camel.
Some men ride horses, but even then they have a hard time, whereas
the ship of the desert, with its spongy padded feet, its nostrils
and eyelids hermetically closed to the dust, and its endurance
without food or water, prove that it was created for this purpose,
and that traveling by any other means is hazardous. It is not a
very rapid conveyance, but one can average a good twenty-five miles
a day and be certain of reaching one’s destination.</p>

<p>Further south one finds the <i>mehari</i>, or trotting white
camel, which moves along at a great pace, but it is reserved almost
entirely for the Meharistes, or French African camel corps, who
guard the lonely caravan tracks of the Sahara.</p>

<p>On leaving Touggourt the road follows the railway through a
country of sandy patches which gradually get stonier as it
progresses north. Pleasant little oases are passed, as well as salt
lakes which are usually practically dry but which give excellent
mirage effects.</p>

<p>We are now in the confederation of the Zibans, one of the most
famous tribes of the south, and to-night we shall be at their
headquarters, the world-famed city of Biskra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII<br>
<span class="sc2">BISKRA</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">With</span> the aid of a railway an English
novelist inadvertently made of Biskra what it is to-day. I say
inadvertently because there is not the least reference to Biskra in
the whole book, and I am sure that Mr. Hichens was the last person
to wish to create of a Sahara oasis a kind of Dieppe-on-sand.
Neither would this town have been so thronged with trippers had it
been miles away in the desert without a railway, but it is so easy
to get into the train at Algiers one night and detrain the next day
in time for lunch in the Sahara that more people come here than to
any other place in the south.</p>

<p>Of course, from the point of view of the country, the change has
brought in a great deal of money and the town has an air of fat
prosperity unknown in the other places we have visited. Arab guides
are paid the wages of colonels and the hiring of camels is as
expensive as a motor-car. The cafés of the Quarter charge what they
please and the numerous Palace hotels have corresponding
prices.</p>

<p>It is a curious place and well worth a visit. It is difficult to
decide which arrival is the most attractive—possibly that from the
south, because the oasis is the first thing seen. It is an
impression of palm-trees, three times as many as at Laghouat, and
as one approaches in the evening, the golden light seems to envelop
their feathery heads in a mysterious radiance as the wind rustles
through them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
</p>

<p>From the northern approach the coloring on the rocks and hills
will perhaps be as wonderful, but there is not that same feeling of
the Sahara because the town masks the oasis.</p>

<p>The largest hotel is the Royal, and from its tower a wonderful
panorama of the desert is spread before one. Unfortunately it is
difficult to keep up this atmosphere long, as it is impossible to
close one’s eyes to the Anglo-Saxon hibernators who have brought
with them their knitting and their bridge and their crossword
puzzles, while the foreign waiters in their starched dickeys jar
horribly after the silence of the Great South. Moreover, if one
steps into the street superb guides in sky-blue robes assail
one—flight north seems the easiest course only to find a gallery of
curiosity shops stocked with gaudy merchandise from Syria. Again
fleeing from the oily merchants toward the sounds of a deep flute,
one finds oneself in a coffee-house, as dirty as in the other
cities, with the only difference that the mint tea costs five
francs. Again in a wretched state of persecution mania one turns
south again and, seeing a brilliantly lighted building of Moorish
architecture, one hurries in; lights dazzle one, the sounds of bad
dance-music strike the ear mingled with monotonous cries of
<i>“Rien ne va plus!”</i> It is the casino, but, just as one is
about to depart again into the night in search of a haven of
refuge, the curious scene arrests one’s steps.</p>

<p>Of all the <i>habitués</i> of casinos in the world I think that
those collected in that of Biskra are the most remarkable. The
Biskra casino has no kind of pattern or atmosphere; it is just an
amazing jumble like the background of one of Mr. Piccasso’s
pictures. The hall is full of cheery French inhabitants of Biskra
sitting at little tables drinking beer, laughing, and occasionally
dancing gaily to the noisy band. A few<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_215">[215]</span> solemn Britons join in the fun, while Arabs
of serene countenance sit and watch without showing the smallest
trace of emotion. At the gaming-tables a party of travel-stained
tourists belonging to a Transatlantic tour are learning the
mysteries of the play under the supervision of the company’s guide
in his khaki uniform plastered with medal ribbons. Two or three
Anglo-Saxons in dinner-jackets, with their consorts in smart
evening gowns, contrast vividly with the robes of the Arab chief
whose turban, unlike those we have seen up to the present, is bound
about with much thicker strands of camel’s hair and crossed and
interwoven in a fashion peculiar to the district.</p>

<p>In a kind of theater, a music-hall show is taking place, partly
composed of the usual French turns, partly of Arab music and
dancing. If one is lucky one may hear the great tenor Mahi-ed-Din
sing the ballads of the Tell. The audience is as mixed as in the
other room, but it is gay, and in spite of oneself one is drawn
back to this scene each night. It has the great advantage over the
native quarter in having no pretensions. It is as genuine as
possible and is certainly unique.</p>

<p>The only peaceful spot in the whole of Biskra is the famous
Jardin Landon, erroneously supposed to be the Garden of Allah. It
is unknown who first spread this story, and it was certainly not
the fault of the author that the legend arose. The Garden of Allah
is, of course, the desert; the land from which Allah has removed
all vegetation and life in order that man may not come and
interfere with his solitude, and where He can walk in peace. The
restful garden in question is a wonderful plantation of tropical
trees and flowers. It was created by the Count Landon de
Longueville, and it gives the impression of a conservatory in the
open air. Paths run about through passages<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_216">[216]</span> of trees; green grass grows in abundance,
and the ceaseless noise of water ever running through the
<i>seguias</i> is as soothing as soft music.</p>

<p>It is a question as to whether the impression of sunset lights
is best seen from its wall or from the tower of the hotel. Both
views are enchanting, but perhaps that of the garden is more vivid,
as it is closer to the desert and to the herds of camels and goats
passing slowly across the dried-up river bed which is the
continuation of the Mzi we saw at Laghouat.</p>

<p>This long, long river which bursts up here and there to create
oases is said by the natives to rise in the Djebel Amour Mountains
above Laghouat and, flowing right across the desert to Southern
Tunisia and Tripoli, finally to disappear in the Nile.</p>

<p>If one has not come up from Touggourt and one is anxious to get
an impression of the sand desert, there is a tract of land to the
southwest, the other side of the oases, which is really worth
seeing. It is a natural fake, like Bou Saada, and a photograph of
the proud traveler sitting on a hired camel can safely be labeled
as having been taken in any part of the “Grand Erg.”</p>

<p>The Village Nègre is worth a visit, and if a horrible curiosity
appeals to one, the dervishes who eat scorpions and glass and
pierce their faces with nails can be seen without difficulty.</p>

<p>Not far away is the oasis of Sidi Okba, which is a good example
of a southern town for those who have cut across from Bou Saada. It
is famous for its mosque, where lies buried Sidi Okba, who was
killed here in his last battle against Koceila, the Berber chief,
in the year <span class="sc2">A. D.</span> 682.</p>

<p>As far as sightseeing, this is about all Biskra can produce. If,
however, one is in this cosmopolitan oasis in the early spring when
the races are taking place, an entertainment is provided which will
not be forgotten.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
The Arab chiefs in this district are wealthier than most of their
colleagues, due to the richness of the date-palms; and owing to the
proximity of Europeans, they are given a great deal more to
entertaining than others. The <i>bash agha</i> of the confederation
of the Zibans keeps open house, and even in the deadest season
never dines alone, but calls in his friends from the street to
share his repast. At the races he outdoes himself in hospitality,
and it is entirely owing to him and to his relations that the
meeting is such a success.</p>

<p>The races consist of three quite separate performances. The
first are so-called flat races, which consist of a wild gallop
round the course for Arab horses of all ages and sizes, mounted by
turbaned bandits who just go “all out” for the first place. No
pulling here.</p>

<p>The second are the officers’ steeplechases, where one sees some
nice horses and some quite good racing.</p>

<p>But the third event, which in reality embraces the whole affair,
is the <i>fantasia</i>. The Arab chiefs from all the surrounding
land muster their tribesmen, who all come mounted, armed to the
teeth, and as wild as children at a birthday party. This kind of
irregular cavalry is known as the <i>goums</i>, and in time of war
it is levied to fight for France. During 1915 a contingent was
fitted out and sent to Flanders, where it behaved heroically. At
the Biskra races the <i>goums</i> make a very brave show, too, in
their flowing burnouses, sitting bolt upright in their high-backed
saddles, their guns across the bow and the curved scimitar beneath
the left saddle-flap. There is a mounted band consisting of two men
with <i>raïtas</i> and one with a <i>tam-tam</i>, while at the head
of the column rides the <i>caïd</i>, clothed from head to foot in
scarlet and purple, his feet in embroidered red leather boots
resting on massive silver stirrups, while beside him rides a
retainer bearing the banner of the tribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
</p>

<p>It is a splendid and majestic sight to see these wild men of the
south passing slowly before the improvised grandstands. After the
orthodox racing is over, and after the <i>bash agha</i> has
entertained endless guests at lunch and tea, it is the turn of
these nomads to show what they are worth. There is a stir in their
ranks, then suddenly two men dash down the course at a furious
speed. As they approach the stand they rise in their stirrups and
fire their guns and fly on. The women, in gaudy taffetas, raise
high tremulous cries. Two more men follow, and then another two;
then one man alone who carries two long guns which he fires
together, tossing them in the air as he disappears in a cloud of
dust. A larger group of horsemen flash past, the air resounds to
the crack of the guns and the cries of the women, but they are gone
before one has realized that they have passed.</p>

<p>A pause. Then all of a sudden a tall figure in scarlet and gold
is seen detaching himself from the other <i>goumiers</i>; he sets
his horse in motion and comes whirling down the course; behind him
rides his standard-bearer, so close that he seems to touch. Behind
him again four retainers in blue burnouses gallop in hot pursuit.
As the <i>caïd</i> approaches the stand he turns sharply and,
aiming at the center of the crowd, fires. The color-bearer dips the
standard, while the retainers, bending forward, draw the curved
scimitars which flash in the setting sun as they wave them above
their heads and sweep on in a whirlwind of dust, while the cries of
the women rend the air.</p>

<p>Oh, it is a brave spectacle, the <i>fantasia</i>, and makes one
realize how far separated are we in Europe from these wanderers of
the south.</p>

<p>There is an Arab proverb which says that “Love lasts three
seconds, the <i>fantasia</i> three minutes, and misery lasts for
ever!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII<br>
<span class="sc2">TIMGAD</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> road, on leaving Biskra, runs due
north over a land which usually looks barren, but which in periods
of rain produces a plentiful crop of cereals. Very soon a ridge is
topped, and Biskra and the Sahara are lost to sight. Some people
will heave a sigh of relief at leaving for the last time these
desolate expanses; others will look back longingly, and these will
return sooner or later. Once the Sahara has gripped the heart there
is nothing in the world which will free it from its hold.</p>

<p>Just over fifty kilometers from Biskra the oasis of El Kantara
is reached, and of all the beauty-spots in North Africa it is one
of the most attractive. It is really better to approach it from the
north, descending from a high level toward an apparently unbroken
barrier of rock. Some trees proclaim the few houses which cluster
about the little Hotel Bertrand, nestling under the towering cliffs
while the river gurgles at its feet.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a cleft appears in the rocks, and the road and the
railway creep out side by side into the plain beyond. It is the
complete contrast of the north and south—of winter and summer. On
one side of the mountain the soil is dark and fertile, and on the
other it is rosy and desertic. The Arabs say that all rain stops
north of the Gorge of El Kantara.</p>

<p>Arriving from the south the first thing we shall see will be the
oasis: a long array of palm-trees shading<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_220">[220]</span> a river which is more than often full of
water. If time permits, it is well worth the trouble to cross over
an iron bridge and visit the curious little villages. There are
some interesting Roman remains and a series of views of the
palmery, which, even if one is not an artist, furnish material for
beautiful photographs.</p>

<p>Proceeding through the Gorge of El Kantara, which incidentally
means the bridge, we come to <i>the</i> bridge, built by the famous
Third Legion which garrisoned this part of North Africa.
Unfortunately it has been badly restored, but the stones used by
the Romans are still there.</p>

<p>The Hotel Bertrand is a restful place, a paradise for painters,
and, if one is interested in climbing or shooting the elusive
moufflon, there is plenty of this sport in the district.</p>

<p>The road climbs on, winding up the steep gradient on to the
cereal plains of Batna. The tall peaks of the Aurès Mountains rise
up, covered with pines and cedars, and in winter often deep in
snow. It is a great contrast after the Sahara. The rest of the road
is uninteresting, as is also the modern town of Batna, where one
will find all comforts as usual at the Transatlantic Hotel.</p>

<p>The traveler will, of course, make his plans before starting,
but it seems opportune to put in some suggestion for the visit to
Timgad. If time presses it is advised to leave Biskra early, lunch
at Batna, or, better still, picnic at Lambèse, go to Timgad, and
return to sleep at Batna. If time is not of importance it would be
far pleasanter to leave Biskra later, spend some time at El
Kantara, lunch there, sleep at Batna, and spend the whole day at
Timgad, and sleep again at Batna.</p>

<p>Or, if Roman ruins do not attract one, go to<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> Timgad in the morning, lunch
there, leaving about three in the afternoon, and arrive at
Constantine for dinner.</p>

<p>As stated in the note at the end of Chapter XXV, it is possible
to do Biskra, Batna, and sleep at Sétif in one burst, which permits
one to be in Algiers the following day.</p>

<p>The road from Batna to Timgad runs over a rolling, inhospitable
country dominated on the right by the frowning Aurès Mountains. The
first place of interest is Lambèse, the Roman Lambæsis. It was
founded at the end of the first century as the headquarters of that
amazing Third Legion which garrisoned North Africa at that period.
It is one of the best existing examples of a military camp, with
its magazines, parade ground, officers’ quarters and military
church. It has also an amphitheater and a few temples, but their
remains are not so interesting as in many other Roman cities. The
prætorium, or rather its entrance, built of massive blocks of
stone, is in a very good state of preservation; through the middle
passed the main roads which ran straight across North Africa—north,
south, east and west. Traces of this masterpiece of engineering are
continually being unearthed.</p>

<p>Leaving Lambèse, the same scenery continues, a triumphal arch is
passed, a few relics of Roman houses, then at the thirtieth
kilometer there appear in the distance two tall pillars, which seem
to leap up out of the plain to a great height and stand pointing to
the sky in solitary grandeur. Straining the eyes, one soon discerns
buildings and more pillars. A great arch defines itself—we are
arriving at the dead city of Timgad. Two thousand years ago the
Emperor Trajan decided to found a settlement for the Roman soldiers
who had fought in the Parthian<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_222">[222]</span> campaigns, and he commanded that Thamugadi
should be built by the men of the Third Legion.</p>

<p>Thus Timgad did not grow up according to the needs of the
settlers, but was conceived and born in its entirety. For this
reason it is one of the most perfect examples of a Roman town of
the period. Some writers have called it the African Pompeii, but,
though the drifting sand preserved it as did the ashes Pompeii,
this is the only thing analogous about the two places. Pompeii was
a seaside resort, a town of pleasure and luxury; Timgad was an
outpost of a mighty empire. Everything was done to make it resemble
as much as possible the settlers’ homes in the mother country, and
it must have been a strange sensation for the Berbers of the Aurès
who ventured down from their mountain homes to see all the
civilized organization going on in the middle of this desolate
land. Timgad was, however, never an important nor even a large
city. Its area did not exceed one hundred and fifty acres and,
though it is interesting to us because it escaped the total
destruction meted out by the Vandals and Arabs to most of the other
Roman cities, it never created anything in particular.</p>

<p>Entering by the northern gate, we find on our right the big
baths. Built with the utmost care and paved with marble brought
from Italy, they contained every improvement of the day, and were
practically identical with the baths of Caracalla at Rome. They are
in a high state of preservation, and it is most interesting to
examine the various devices for bringing in water and for heating
the many chambers.</p>

<p>Walking up the street from the baths, one passes what must have
been shops; only the lower parts of the walls remain. The first
building of interest discloses itself on the left. There is a
pillared portico and a kind of altar with shelves around; the
inscription<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
suggests that it was the public library, but this is not certain.
It may have been the shrine of the Lares—household gods.</p>

<p>The street now leads into the Decumanus Maximus, the main
thoroughfare. Graceful columns line either side, leading into what
must have been large houses. The paving-stones, placed diagonally
to prevent their being worn away by the chariots, are nevertheless
deeply rutted. Between the chinks can be seen the drain which ran
beneath the middle of the way. Immediately opposite this
intersection are the steps leading up to the forum: a white-paved
court with many pillars, some fifty yards long, with at one end a
tribunal where sat the judge. There must have been many statues,
but they are no more.</p>

<p>Just below the forum, on the north side, are the public latrines
which, with their carved hand-rests, are interesting and worth
examining.</p>

<p>On the south side of the forum there is a charming inscription:
<i>“Veneri, lavari, ludere, ridere—occe est vita!”</i> “Hunting,
bathing, gambling, laughing—this is life!”</p>

<p>Climbing out on an eminence above the forum, we come to the
theater. The auditorium is hollowed out of the hill and is in a
fine state of preservation. The seating accommodation makes the
modern play-goer think, as from every stall the stage is fully
visible and the acoustic properties are faultless. Looking across
from the theater can be seen the tall pillars we first espied from
the road; they are the ruins of the Temple of Jupiter on the
capitol. The pillars are immense, fifty feet high, with each
capitol three feet, making a total of fifty-six feet. In the middle
was a gigantic statue of Jupiter, now in the Louvre in Paris. There
is nothing so drearily desolate, so terribly silent, as the two
pillars of this temple. It seems as if they<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_224">[224]</span> stood there to warn the people who pass
of the vanity of human things.</p>

<p>Near by are some interesting villas of a more luxurious
conception than those we saw before. The rooms are more numerous
and spacious, and there is a reservoir for keeping fish.</p>

<p>On the hill behind the capitol, stand the remains of a Christian
church, with a baptistery of which the mosaics are in a perfect
state of preservation. Leaving this Christian church, we now
retrace our steps, leaving the capitol on the right, and make for
the triumphal arch of which we have already caught a glimpse from
the Decumanus Maximus. Before reaching it there is an interesting
market-place. The large court is surrounded by a colonnade, and the
stone counters of the shops are just as they were at the time.
Opposite the market-place is a small temple, but what strikes the
attention at once is the triumphal arch of Trajan. It has three
openings, and niches for statues, and is certainly the most
imposing monument of Algeria.</p>

<p>Hence we can wander back through narrow streets to the gate by
which we entered, and near which stands the museum which is well
worth a visit. In addition to all sorts of curiosities such as
hair-pins, needles and implements for dentistry of the time, it
contains some of the fine mosaics which have been unearthed from
the houses and pieced together. If we look at them for a moment and
imagine what they looked like up there near the capitol, we can get
a small idea of how charming the residences must have been. There
are also drawings of what it is supposed Timgad was like in the
days of its glory, and certainly, if the artist was not carried
away by his imagination— and there is no reason to suppose this—it
must have been indeed a noble city. And yet its aspect
now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span> leaves the
traveler with a feeling of sorrow. The silence is, first of all,
appalling; the atmosphere of desolation is impossible to convey in
words, and, as one sits in the forum or on the stone steps of the
theater and tries to conjure up the gay figures who once frequented
these now silent spaces, one is filled with an unspeakable awe. All
this luxury, all this amusement, all these habitations—for what?
For the future planned by Imperial Rome, since it is evident that
no nation would have built the great town, with all in it, as a
mere pastime. They intended to stay; they believed in their
unshakable greatness; they believed in the power of the sword.</p>

<p>But Rome fell, as had fallen other empires, and as others will
also fall. And Timgad is left to the jackals and to the hyenas, to
a few intelligent excavators, and to the host of chattering
tourists who rush through these ruins of a glorious past without a
thought for the cultured race who once lived there.</p>

<p>“Vanity, vanity—all is vanity!”</p>

<p>For this reason I have said as little as possible on this city
of the dead, and I leave it to the traveler to go himself and feel
the atmosphere which no painter or writer can reproduce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV<br>
<span class="sc2">DJEMILA THE DESOLATE</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">If Roman</span> ruins are of interest to the
traveler there is a second edition of Timgad, to my mind finer and
more complete than the subject of the last chapter, but
unfortunately not on any main road.</p>

<p>I refer to the town of Cuicul, now called Djemila, situated on
the barren hills to the northeast of Sétif. There are two means of
access: from Algiers via Sétif, or from Constantine via the road to
Djidjelli, described in the next chapter.</p>

<p>From Sétif the main road to Constantine is followed for thirty
kilometers to Saint Arnaud, where one turns sharp left and begins
climbing into a rolling country of cereals sparsely cultivated
until, after some thirty more kilometers of winding roads, one
reaches Djemila. The other route branches out of the
Constantine-Djidjelli road at Zeraîa, sixty-five kilometers from
Constantine, and soon begins climbing up into the rolling country
described above, rejoining the Sétif approach some fifty kilometers
farther on, and ten from Djemila.</p>

<p>The first aspect of the ruins is certainly more impressive than
that of Timgad. The road has been winding along the side of a steep
hill, high up through a country so harsh and desolate that one
looks about apprehensively as if the dead themselves guarded the
bare slopes, watching over the scenes of their great triumphs.</p>

<p>Then suddenly at a bend in this sad road the eye<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span> suddenly distinguishes, on a
kind of promontory far below, something which at first looks like a
great graveyard. Then gradually, as one watches, the stones detach
themselves from the gray surroundings, graceful pillars rise up,
triumphal arches, the massive walls of a temple. . . .</p>

<p>We are looking down on what was once one of the most prosperous
cities of that dead empire which ruled Algeria as no one since has
ruled it. The road winds down toward the miniature village outside
the site of the ancient city. The Compagnie Transatlantique has, as
usual, a comfortable hotel, in fact it is the only hotel, and if
the traveler ventures to this lonely spot out of the tourist season
he will have to carry his own food and sleep out-of-doors. This is,
as a matter of fact, quite feasible, as during the summer months
the heat of Djemila is intense.</p>

<p>The excavation of Djemila has been carried out with much more
care and system than that of the other Roman cities in Algeria;
this is chiefly due to the intelligent interest taken in the place
by its curator, the Comtesse de Crésolles. This charming lady lives
in a comfortable house overlooking the ruins, and if the visitor
has the good fortune to make her acquaintance he will find in her a
fund of information about the excavations, and an untiring
guide.</p>

<p>Djemila can be seen in a morning, but a week would seem more
like the period required really to study the ruins properly. The
first thing that strikes one on entering the precincts of the ruins
is why this town was built on a spur so far below the mountains
which tower menacingly above. The reason is quite clear. At the end
of the first century, when the city was founded, the main roads ran
along the bottom of the valleys, and it was therefore necessary to
plan the military centers at some point where they not only
formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span> a guard over
the long arteries of civilization, but also a stage for the
caravans as they passed up and down from Constantine and from the
coast. But quite apart from the military side of the question,
Djemila under the Romans was one of the great cereal centers of the
empire and within its walls the grain was brought to be despatched
to the far-flung limits of the mighty empire.</p>

<p>The first portion of the town to be visited is the Christian
quarter. Begun in the third century it rapidly grew in importance
and was undoubtedly the see of a bishop. The great basilica of
Cresconius was built by this Christian bishop as a mausoleum for
his predecessors. There are two other churches excavated near this
cathedral, and there are no doubt other important buildings still
under the earth.</p>

<p>The most interesting edifice, perhaps the most interesting in
all the Roman remains on account of its state of preservation, is
the baptistery. To the reader used to well-preserved churches and
art museums in Europe it is difficult to convey the real impression
created on the mind on entering the low doorway of this first
evidence of Christianity in this part of the world: outside, the
desolation of the barren hills and the sadness of the gray ruins;
inside, the fresh color of mosaics, stuccoed niches, graceful
pillars. A gallery runs round the actual place of immersion, lined
with hollowed-out seats, reminding one of the stalls in some
university chapel in England. Rich gold mosaics stud the walls; on
the floor all kinds of intricate designs in rich colors, which make
one realize the trouble taken by that dead race to beautify all
that was their work.</p>

<p>At each end of the baptistery, two doors lead into the center
portion where the converts were christened. The floor is carpeted
with delicately colored pictures<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_229">[229]</span> of fishes and seashells; above, a canopy
carved out of one block of solid stone rests on four pillars; on
the floor of the primitive font a mosaic inscription in Latin
reads:</p>

<p class="quote">“A day will come when all people will have been
baptized.”</p>

<p>It is with a feeling of reverence that one quits this jewel in
the midst of the ruins.</p>

<p>It seems useless to describe the other edifices in detail; they
are like all Roman ruins, and require the atmosphere of loneliness
to produce their effect. A few words will suffice:</p>

<p>The theater is in about the same state of preservation as at
Timgad. It is, however, being gradually restored, and will soon be
in its original state. Only the other day (1926) a company of the
Comedie Française gave a performance of <i>Œdipus Rex</i> on its
stage.</p>

<p>Leaving the theater it is advised to take the path leading to
the northwestern extremity of the ruins, passing the baths of the
capitol and various private houses. Turning to the left, one enters
the capitol which formed the northern extremity of the old forum.
The temple of Jupiter, with its six columns forty-two feet high,
rose majestically above the other buildings; a colossal statue was
in the center. Now only two bases of columns can be seen in place,
the remains of others lie about the steps and before the altar of
sacrifice.</p>

<p>The ruts of the chariot wheels are less distinct in the Cardo
Maximus here than at Timgad. The drain down the center is clearly
visible.</p>

<p>The new forum is very impressive. On the right a triumphal arch
seems to leap from the earth almost<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_230">[230]</span> intact in the middle of the ruins. An
inscription dated 216 tells that it was raised in honor of
Caracalla, conqueror of many nations. On the other side of the open
space stands a great temple. Broad steps lead up to the lofty
pillars supporting the remains of a roof; the walls, though shorn
of their marble facings, are almost intact. Another inscription
states that the temple is in honor of the family of the Emperor
Septimus Severus and was erected in the year 229 by the Republic of
Cuicul. From the entrance a fine view can be had of the original
city.</p>

<p>The visit has been rapidly accomplished, and only the great
baths remain to be seen on our way to the hotel. As usual they are
magnificent in all their luxury; nothing seems to have been omitted
by these Romans in their far-away exile to make their homes as like
as possible what they had left in the northern country.</p>

<p>It rather reminds one of the Briton who, in all his arrogance,
carries his clubs, and his drinks, and his games into whatever
distant corner of the Empire he settles himself. To the Roman
nothing was good which was not from Rome. It is rather the same
with us, and I suppose it will always be so. Machinery makes life
more complicated, but it does not change the mentality of
mankind.</p>

<p>There is a good museum near the hotel where the excavators have
collected the best things found in the ruins. Apart from the usual
implements of daily life, seen in greater profusion at Timgad,
there are some very fine mosaics. It would take too long to
describe them, but to those interested the museum is well worth a
visit, and when one looks upon those lovely designs, so intricate,
so artistic, one wonders why the Arab and the Algerian of to-day
does not copy his floors from these pictures in stone instead of
plastering everything<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_231">[231]</span> with hideous modern flags of impossible
colors. And yet even the beauties of those Roman cities of the past
do not bear comparison with the monuments of the mother
country.</p>

<p>There is something coarse, unoriginal in them, which at first
leaves one wondering, until one suddenly realizes that one is in
the presence of the Roman colonists, the expatriated wanderer who
set out to seek his fortune overseas, the retired soldier or the
rich grain merchant. He tried to copy what he had at home; he did
better than would a present-day colonist from England or France,
but it was not the real thing.</p>

<p>Still, the dead cities of that great empire are of vast interest
and, to those who like to live in the past, it is a joy to wander
through the silent streets and realize how great and civilized this
colony once was, and how still greater the desolation and misery
caused by the advent of the Arab.</p>

<p>From Djemila the traveler can either return to Algiers direct or
continue the voyage through Constantine, or, if time presses, he
can leave out Constantine and make direct for Djidjelli.</p>

<p>For the moment we must turn our attention to the third city of
Algeria, the first city of Christianity under the Emperor
Constantine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV<br>
<span class="sc2">CONSTANTINE TO THE COAST</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> scenery along the road to
Constantine by either route differs little from that just passed.
It is a land of cereals, once upon a time properly irrigated by the
people of a great empire, now sadly dependent on the rainfall.</p>

<p>The approach to the city is impressive. It seems to stand out on
a rocky pinnacle, and as one crosses the bridge and looks down into
the depths of the Gorges of the Rhummel, one suddenly wonders if it
is not all a stage setting: chasms, perpendicular cliffs, natural
rock bridges and tunnels, the houses clinging dizzily to the rock
wall, and, far beneath, the silver streak of the river. Constantine
was originally the capital of the Numidian kings, and was known as
Cirta. Syphax, Massinissa, and Micipsa ruled here, but it was not
until the fourth century and after it had been destroyed during one
of the many conflicts which raged round its walls, that it was
rebuilt by the Emperor Constantine.</p>

<p>Its history during the rest of time is a series of revolts and
conspiracies, and, though a few of the beys during the Turkish rule
built some lovely houses, its record is not elevating. There are
only three interesting things to visit, and they can all be done in
the day. First is the Gorges of the Rhummel, a most amazing
spectacle of natural arches and passages hundreds of feet below the
level of the town. When finally the river bursts out of this chasm
into the open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span> plain
at the foot of a perpendicular rock towering up to dizzy heights it
is like the entrance of a giant church. To the top of this rock,
which watches over the whole plain of historic interest, tiresome
or unfaithful wives of the bey were taken, placed in a sack with a
cat, and hurled to their doom below. No one has yet been able to
explain the cat, but I suppose it added to the fun of the
thing.</p>

<p>Standing once on the summit of this pinnacle with a Scotch
friend who was traveling without his better half, I recounted this
story. He was a man of few words, and for a moment he made no
reply; then, peering cautiously over the precipitous edge, he
exclaimed, “Oh, for the good old days!”</p>

<p>The next place to visit is the palace of the bey of Constantine.
It is now used as the divisional headquarters, and, though it is
not properly kept up, one can get an impression of something very
lovely: a series of courts open to the sky with marble floors and
delicate pillars, enclosing miniature gardens, in the middle of
which fountains splash gaily. The walls are covered with
multi-colored tiles, while the ceilings and doors of rare wood are
adorned with intricate carvings. On a sunny day it is a vision of
blue and white and green and orange, and, though the drab clothes
of the modern inmates and the click of the typewriting machine jar
on the senses, one can imagine the enchanting atmosphere of these
quiet courts when men in splendid robes passed in and out, followed
by their dark-skinned slaves.</p>

<p>Communicating with the palace is the present-day cathedral, in
the old time the mosque of the bey, who could pass unseen from his
residence to his devotions. The French have enlarged it, but it is
quite easy to see what was the original building. Here again there
are some very lovely blue tiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
</p>

<p>There are other mosques, also Jewish and Arab quarters, which
are worth a visit if the traveler has not been anywhere else, but
after the long journey with all its scenes of Arab life, it will
suffice to visit the above-mentioned places and return to rest,
prior to the journey to the coast.</p>

<p>By starting early one will be able to lunch at Djidjelli, and
the afternoon run along the <i>corniche</i> to Bougie can then be
taken leisurely. The first impression on starting is that of hills.
Up to the present all traveling has been done across rolling
plains, but serious gradients have been unknown. The descent from
the crag on which Constantine is perched again makes one wonder how
it was captured by force. The cereal lands continue to give to the
country a very desertic appearance, and, though it is not the
desert of stones and rock, the rolling fields, with lonely farms,
do not attract one to stay. One gets good examples of the desertion
of villages by the French colonists, always yearning to get to the
big towns near the coast.</p>

<p>Mila, at the fifty-fourth kilometer, was once a Roman city of
importance; it is the last village of any size we shall pass.
Thence onward the country is very wild. At Zeraïa (junction of the
road from Djemila mentioned in the last chapter) we traverse
forbidding gorges, after which the road runs for a few kilometers
across a small plain of olive-yards, crosses a river, and then
starts the long climb to the Col de Fdoules.</p>

<p>The road is a masterpiece of engineering as it climbs dizzily
along the steep cliff of the mountain. At the hundred and fourth
kilometer the Col, three thousand feet above the sea, is reached;
from the watershed there is one of the finest mountain views in
North Africa. To the north and to the south the hills rise up sheer
and the valleys are lost in deep<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_235">[235]</span> shade. The road then runs down into the
Gorges of Taberkroutz and for the first time after the long travel,
trees appear quite close. The road climbs up again and the woods
approach, until soon we are in a thick forest. At the Col de
Texenna a splendid panorama of forests and mountains is spread out
before one. It is a wonderful sensation to return to luxuriant
vegetation after the perpetual desert, and the sound of water with
the smell of the damp earth revives the mind, weary with staring
over limitless expanses. Another sensation of delight seizes one as
the sea comes in view and, rapidly approaching the shore, the road
follows it to Djidjelli.</p>

<p>One can either lunch at the hotel or picnic in pleasant
surroundings, but whatever plan is adopted the new atmosphere and
the fresh air will give one the appetite of the proverbial hunter.
Djidjelli was originally a Phœnician settlement, and later, under
the Romans, was an important harbor. It is most famous as being the
first capital of Barbarossa the elder, who came here after his
first failure to dislodge the Spaniards from Algiers, and when his
original Tunisian lair at the island of Djerba had become too
inhospitable for him to return. His greatness began with his
election as Sultan of this little seaside city. His conquests and
raids are world famous, and though it was his younger brother who
eventually ruled Algiers and became the scourge of the
Mediterranean, it was the temporary Sultan of Djidjelli who in
reality was responsible for the pirate fleet which was to terrorize
the sea from its headquarters in Algiers for three hundred
years.</p>

<p>At the present day Djidjelli is the center of the cork trade.
The forests cover an area of one hundred and fifty thousand acres,
and cork is exported from the harbor to ports all over the
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
</p>

<p>The road along the seacoast from Djidjelli to Bougie is one of
the loveliest in North Africa. Deep red cliffs look down on to the
sapphire blue of the Mediterranean, while the green of the forests
above contrasts again with the azure of the sky. Natural tunnels
are traversed, and here and there the road clings dizzily to the
perpendicular rocks. This road, like many others in North Africa,
is a wonderful piece of engineering.</p>

<p>At the thirty-sixth kilometer stone there are some marvelous
caves well worth a visit. An Arab looks after them, who will
illuminate the multitude of stalactites and stalagmites which adorn
its fairylike halls, creating a vision of enchantment.</p>

<p>Pretty little villages succeed pretty little villages, where one
would like to spend the day lazily watching the tranquil sea. In
the hills there are masses of game and wild boar abounds;
occasionally one sees monkeys—the famous Barbary ape.</p>

<p>Bougie has a Spanish aspect, but is in itself not particularly
interesting. In Roman times it was a colony for veteran soldiers,
and later it became like most Algerian ports, a harbor for pirates.
Charles Quint spent a few days here after his disastrous attempt to
capture Algiers. If time permits there are some delightful
excursions round about, but the traveler by this time is probably
so weary of motoring and contemplating scenery that he will want to
return to his trunks and his comforts in Algiers.</p>

<p>As stated in the plan of the journey there are now four
alternatives before us—the direct run to Algiers via Bouira and
Palestro, or via Azazga and Tizi Ouzou—or else, if time permits it,
by Michelet and the Massif Kabyle or by Tigzirt, the coast, and
Dellys.</p>

<p>By Bouira and Palestro the road runs through a smiling valley
and the return to Algiers can either<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_237">[237]</span> be made via the gorges and Menerville or by
the Bouzigza Pass. By Azazga and Tizi Ouzou or by Tigzirt the same
routes will be followed as far as Azazga; the road rises rapidly up
through woodlands to the Col de Tigdint, whence a superb panoramic
view of the Kabyle Mountains can be seen on one side, while all
about appear those quaint stone villages perched on the summits of
every peak. Running down again, the forest of Yakouren is entered,
and the road wanders through delightful glades, restful to the
eyes, until the little village of Azazga is reached. It is
recommended to picnic in the forest.</p>

<p>If Algiers is the goal it is straight ahead.</p>

<p>Tizi Ouzou, apart from its name, has nothing curious;
silversmiths make massive jewelry here, but there is no need to
stop. The road runs through orchards and tobacco plantations rather
monotonously after all the gorgeous scenery of the rest of the
journey, and the arrival in Algiers will be welcomed.</p>

<p>If the road via Tigzirt has been selected one must turn off to
the right some six kilometers after Azazga. The road continues
bearing to the right and climbs steeply up to a Col whence one gets
a magnificent view to the south of the Djujura range, deep in snow
in winter. The road now runs down to the coast and then follows it
for twenty-six kilometers to the little seaside resort of
Tigzirt.</p>

<p>Here, if time does not press, and if one does not mind
primitive, though clean, comforts, one can pass the night in the
hotel and thus have an opportunity of visiting the delightful ruins
of an old Phœnician settlement, later Romanized.</p>

<p>Thence the run to Algiers is via the seacoast to Dellys, and
after that the dull Tizi Ouzou road—one hundred and fifty
kilometers in all.</p>

<p>It is, however, hoped that the season of the year<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span> will have permitted the
traveler to visit the Great Kabyle country, and in the next chapter
I will endeavor to describe the scenery and the people of this
district, which is almost as unique as the Mzab.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI<br>
<span class="sc2">KABYLIE</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> Kabyle country lies to the
northeastern extremity of the department of Algiers, with a small
portion lapping over into the department of Constantine as far as
Bougie. It begins at Palestro, runs down to the sea, and is bounded
on the south by the road from El Kseur to Bouira. It seems curious
to speak of a country in the middle of a French department, and yet
its physical boundaries are as defined as its people. Like the wild
men of the Aurès, the Kabyles are hardy mountaineers of the same
race—the Berbers. Perhaps a little purer than the people of the
Aurès, who undoubtedly intermarried with Roman soldiers when the
Empire fell, whereas their cousins of the north have remained
intact since the days when the foreigner had not set foot in
Africa.</p>

<p>The actual area of the country is about thirty-eight hundred
square miles, and is composed of great mountains running up at some
points to an altitude of six thousand feet, and deep in snow from
December to March.</p>

<p>Unlike the people of the Mzab, the Kabyle types vary
considerably, and though the majority are tall, blond men, one
notices many who are small and dark. They have the same spirit of
independence as the Berbers of Ghardaïa, with the great difference
that they are all warriors and brook no interference. There is no
area in Algeria which has caused so much trouble<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span> to the French, and even now
the inhabitants consider themselves superior to all other races,
and only accept the foreign rule because they have to. In spite of
this these people never seem to have had any sort of main state,
and though the word <i>zouaoua</i>, from which is derived the
appellation of the French regiment <i>Zouaves</i>, is the name
given to this group of Berbers, they have always been a divided
nation; and it is only since the French fully pacified them that
they have ceased to be in a perpetual state of internal war. These
wars usually originated as vendettas, it being admitted that a man
killed required another man killed and that all disputes about land
must be settled by the sword.</p>

<p>Before this period each village was a kind of little republic of
its own with the principle of government of the people by the
people, that is to say that the <i>Djemma</i>, or local council,
was supposed to be composed of all the men who had attained their
majority. As a matter of fact this was rarely put into practise,
and the government of the village lay in the hands of the heads of
families, the elders and a few young men of note. These men elected
an Amine, who presided over the assembly, which decided every
detail concerning the daily life of the community. The Amine had,
however, little real power, as his position depended on the
good-will of the other members over whom he presided, and who could
by a simple ballot dismiss him. It was a state of absolute
socialism, and the man of good family or the richest farmer had no
more authority than the poorest laborer.</p>

<p>Moreover, to this day there is no distinction of class; there
are no fine houses for the prosperous; the beggar and the rich man
wear the same rags and live in the same squalor. The <i>Djemma</i>
still exists and the simple stone seat on which the worthies sit
can be seen in any village. The wars or vendettas also
continue,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span> but in a
somewhat more discreet manner, and though they still speak of the
<i>Cof Oufella</i>, the clan of the higher levels, and the <i>Cof
Bouadda</i>, the clan of those below, the French do all they can to
keep order.</p>

<p>They are all naturally industrious farmers, and though the
difficulty of cultivating this steep land, combined with the
density of the population, makes farming no easy matter, the
results are amazing. The growing of cereals holds a minor place in
their agriculture, and their attention is chiefly directed to
trees, especially the fig and the olive, of which the fruits are
regularly exported. Owing to the overcrowded population, however,
one finds few large landed proprietors, and the ownership of
property is carried to the most ludicrous extremes. For instance, a
whole family may own a fig-tree without owning the land on which it
grows, and cases have been known of a man who owned an olive-tree
hiring out the branches to the olive exporters.</p>

<p>The family ideals are the same as among all Berber groups:
absolute respect for the head of the family, precedence for the
males, but unlike the modern Arab family, no position at all for
the women. It is true that polygamy is much rarer here than in the
rest of North Africa, but this is largely due to economy rather
than to anything else. Otherwise the wife is an absolute slave, and
one is at once struck on the roads by the sight of Monsieur riding
his mule while Madame trudges behind. As soon as a girl is of
marriageable age, and often before, she is bought, and from that
moment she must do all her husband’s work, bear and bring up his
children and, if he wishes, be divorced. Even if he dies she is not
allowed to keep her children, who are taken over by the man’s
family as soon as weaned. Moreover, no woman can inherit from a
man. When she has passed the period of bearing<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_242">[242]</span> children she is relegated to the status
of a beast of burden. Against this she has much more liberty to go
about unattended, and she is not veiled. Small compensation!</p>

<p>It is hard to instil different principles into these wild
people, as they are very hostile to all forms of European
interference, and it is with the utmost difficulty that the
children are made to go to the French school.</p>

<p>What is still more extraordinary to note is the fact that men
who have been educated and who have actually been to Europe will
return to their villages and, without the smallest hesitation,
rebegin their old life, sleeping on the floor near their donkeys or
their horses, while the women chop wood and do the rough work.
Neither are these isolated cases as, since the war, many an old
soldier, realizing the unequal struggle in his own country, has
gone to France as a workman in a factory, and during that period
has made money which has been regularly sent back to the family in
the mountains, but once weary of Europe he has returned to his
people to lead the same life as before. Berbers they were two
thousand years ago, Berbers they are still, and, like the men of
the Mzab and of the Hoggar, of the Aurès and of the Riff, they
remain unaltered, and there seems little prospect of anything
changing them.</p>

<p>As in the Mzab, the villages differ considerably from those of
the Arabs of the plain. Here again we find the town built on a
pinnacle. Practically every peak in the Kabyle Mountains is
dominated by a group of houses which cling dizzily above steep
precipices. The houses themselves are small, low and squalid; the
better ones consist of three rooms very slightly separated from one
another. One room for the men, one for the women and children, and
one for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
animals, but there are many cases where men and beasts all dwell
together.</p>

<p>The men are poorly dressed, and one never sees the prosperous
white robes of the Mzabite nor the costly burnous of the Arab
chief, but in spite of their rags they stalk along the road, stick
in hand, the head high, and a look of defiance in their clear eyes.
The women, on the other hand, wear brilliant colors—red and yellow
and green; their heads are wrapped in high turban-like head-dresses
consisting of many scarfs wound one above the other. Their faces,
unveiled, are handsome and, contradictorily to their status, have
usually an expression of great gaiety. Like most people who have
never known anything better, their lot seems to them normal, and
they have no other ambition.</p>

<p>They are all very superstitious—childishly so, and they carry
countless antidotes against spells and the Evil Eye. Their courage
is proverbial, and they callously bear pain. A man who had been
stabbed in the abdomen was seen to push back his intestines into
the gaping wound, mount his mule and ride off to the nearest French
authorities to make his complaint. A doctor once said that if he
saw a Kabyle cut in half he would not give a death certificate
until he was sure that the heart had stopped beating!</p>

<p>Unfortunately space forbids my recounting countless anecdotes
and stories about them. Like the Mzab, this is a country where one
can linger quietly for some weeks and never have a dull day.</p>

<p>The road from Bougie to Michelet runs first of all along the
foot of the Kabyle Mountains, giving one an excellent idea of the
isolation of this district from the rest of Algeria. Great barren
peaks rise up and the red earth of the slopes contrasts brilliantly
with the olive-yards and fig plantations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
</p>

<p>Shortly after Akbou we meet the road from Sétif to Algiers via
Boaria, which can be taken if the suggestion to run straight
through to Algiers from Timgad has been followed, or if one is
making straight from Bougie to Algiers via Palestro. Our own course
is to the north and, turning sharply to the right, the road begins
to climb steeply up into the mountains. It is a magnificent drive,
and the panorama from the Col de Tirourda is one of the most superb
in North Africa. The whole of this great system of mountains is
around us, chain succeeds chain, with the quaint little villages
perched on the top of every point of vantage. It is as new a
scenery as the Mzab, and one is hardly able to realize that barely
a week ago one was staring across those desolate plains of stone
and rock. The road winds on along the edge of precipitous slopes to
Michelet.</p>

<p>Here there is an excellent Transatlantic hotel which, unlike
most of its sisters, is open summer and winter, Michelet being a
holiday resort for the overheated business men of Constantine and
Algiers.</p>

<p>If one has time, there are many delightful excursions to be made
from here, but to carry out the program we must leave the following
morning. The road continues circling along the side of the
mountain; little villages appear on the hilltops and give place to
other villages until the fortified town of Fort National is
reached. From here the gradient is very steep down to Tizi Ouzou,
where lunch can be taken if the more preferable picnic has not been
consumed under a group of fig-trees.</p>

<p>From Tizi Ouzou the road runs dully back to Algiers through
tobacco plantations.</p>

<p>And so the journey is over, and though at first the mind will be
unable to grasp all that has been seen and that feeling of a long
evening at the cinema will hold<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_245">[245]</span> it for some time, little by little the
ever-changing scenes will detach themselves in order and remain
photographed on the brain as an undying memory.</p>

<p>The vine-clad Mitidja, the Atlas, the rolling plain of the
Sersou and the Hauts Plateaux, the rocky desolation of the Mzab,
the golden sands of Touggourt contrasting suddenly with the
cosmopolitan crowd at Biskra, the silent ruins of Timgad and the
business town of Constantine, the first view of the hills and the
sea, the blue and scarlet of the <i>corniche</i> road to Bougie,
and the towering peaks of the Kabyle peopled by a strange race of
the past, until the white city of Algiers is reached, with its
palaces and its gardens and its damp atmosphere.</p>

<p>All these things will gradually unwind themselves from the
recesses of the brain, to form one vast panorama, and as one sits
at home a few weeks later one will say to one’s self
incredulously:</p>

<p>“Did I really see all this in a fortnight, and all in the same
country?”</p>

<h2><a id="c37"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII<br>
<span class="sc2">TRAVELING OFF THE BEATEN TRACK</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">Having</span> now followed in the paths of the
tourist and the official tours of the Compagnie Transatlantique, it
will perhaps be interesting to cast a glance at the less-frequented
routes. There is no doubt that once one leaves the beaten track in
Algeria one travels in comparative discomfort, and that the
accommodation is, to say the least of it, primitive. Neither is it
necessary to go far from the main center to find these
discomforts.</p>

<p>On the other hand, unless one has these experiences one does not
get to know the real people of the country whether they be Arabs or
Frenchmen. The true Algerian colonist is there in all his
roughness, talking vaguely about France as a paradise, which he may
never have seen, in spite of the little distance which separates
Europe from North Africa; treating the natives with a curious
mixture of comradeship and harshness, little interested in affairs
not affecting his actual district, and as unlike an Englishman in
the same situation as it is possible to imagine.</p>

<p>The common Arab, poor, ill-fed, lazy, working just as long as it
is necessary, dishonest when it is worth while, and quite
unscrupulous in matters of life and death, exists there with little
ambition, while the Arab chiefs whom one has perhaps met in
magnificent clothes at some official function live in these lost
districts without any ostentation. The only method of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span> communication between the
villages, and they are usually some sixty or eighty miles apart, is
by road. Some of the richer cultivators and <i>caïds</i> have
motor-cars; the well-to-do Arab rides, but it is usual to travel by
the motor <i>diligence</i> which carries the mails. The
<i>diligence</i> usually starts early in the morning, as, though it
travels a good twenty miles an hour, there is always the danger of
a breakdown with no question of outside help, and as they are under
government contract it is essential that they should have plenty of
time to spare.</p>

<p>The bus is almost full at the start, but it expands its
accommodation in a most astonishing way as it picks up travelers
who sit by the roadside, and when it arrives at its destination the
roof and the running-boards are crowded with Arabs. People who have
correspondence for the post also wait at appointed places with
their letters, which are collected by the driver and taken along.
And in the same way the mail for the districts where there are no
roads is picked up by the postman as the <i>diligence</i> dashes
by.</p>

<p>Occasionally in years of famine there are holdups, and though
the driver is always armed, it is of little avail. The road is
barred at some convenient spot where there is cover, the
<i>diligence</i> stops, and before any one realizes what has
occurred the track is seething with Arabs armed with blunder-busses
and bludgeons, who take all there is, puncture the tires and
disappear as mysteriously as they came.</p>

<p>Another form of delay is often created in summer by locusts,
which drift in great clouds across the road and in an inconceivably
short space of time clog up all the wheels with the fat of their
crushed bodies. And it is extremely difficult to clear them out and
go on if they are in any numbers.</p>

<p>The arrival of the <i>diligence</i> in a small center is
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span> great event. The
postmaster, who is also the telegrapher and postman and bookkeeper,
comes out with much dignity to receive the mail; Arabs crowd round
and gossip with the occupants of the second-class compartment or
with those on the roof; the tall gendarme walks up and down with a
look of imminent arrest on his mustached countenance. At the
terminus there is the same sensation while the European traveler,
stiff and dusty, wends his way to the only inn. It is always a
“Grand” Hotel “Something” with from twelve to twenty rooms. There
are many which are simply comfortable, where one gets a good
<i>cuisine bourgeoise</i>; these are among the smaller and more
remote and kept by a family of French people, the father looking
after the café, the mother cooking, the children doing all the rest
of the work. Meals are served at a common table with the family.
The rooms are sparsely furnished, but they are clean. But there are
many hotels where hygiene is unknown, where the food is cooked by
an Arab and is foully oily, and the rooms! . . . Too much or too
little can not be said about them, and the traveler is advised to
cast the well-used sheets into the farthest corner of the chamber,
place the mattress on the floor, put on his longest pair of
trousers and his stoutest boots and wrap himself up in his cloak.
If he is fortunate he will rise next morning immune from the night
attack of the denizens of the bedstead, but that is all.</p>

<p>Market-day is the time to see these little towns at their best.
It usually takes place on a Friday, the Mohammedan Sunday, and from
midday Thursday long caravans of Arabs with their flocks begin
appearing on the horizon and move slowly across the wide plain
toward the market town. Camels pad disdainfully along while the
humble donkey trots beside, great flocks of white sheep with their
advance guard of goats<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_249">[249]</span> throwing up clouds of dust. The roads too
have their complement of travelers, and carriages and carts jolt
along bearing Arabs and French farmers; there are also horsemen and
pedestrians, while the motor-car and the <i>diligence</i> bring
buyers from Algiers.</p>

<p>It is a marvelous sight to see the streets of the little town
thronged with every type of Arab. Clear-eyed men from the nomad
tribes of the Larbas, and the Chambas in the far south; tall men
with haughty looks from the mountains, thin, wiry men from the
rolling plains of the Sersou, stout little Mzabites, pale and
bearded, selling their wares to the credulous Arabs as their
Phœnician ancestors did in the same land two thousand years ago.
Here and there an Arab chief— an <i>agha</i> or a <i>caïd</i>—in a
brilliant cloth burnous, moves in stately manner, greeting friends
with the brotherly embrace and receiving the kiss of submission on
the shoulder from the members of his tribe with as much dignity as
a king of old accepting homage from his vassals.</p>

<p>When night falls the little hotel is full of bronzed-faced
colonists and wool merchants and sheep breeders, discussing the
prospects of the harvest and the probable price of wool and
livestock over glasses of anisette and water. The scene in the café
is really a most entertaining spectacle of all classes and races
mingling in friendly chat.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is an Arab flutist from the far south earning
his dinner, sometimes there is a Spanish sheep-farmer with his
guitar, sometimes there is a row among Arabs and one sees the glint
of the steel dagger, which alone the children of the Faithful know
how to wield with dexterous rapidity.</p>

<p>In the Arab coffee-houses too the animation is great, and the
guests flow out into the streets and squat by the wall holding
their cups of coffee or mint<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_250">[250]</span> tea in their hands. Inside some one is
singing a ballad, accompanied by a flute or a mandolin, while up
the road one can hear the rhythmical beat of the <i>tam-tam</i> and
strident squeal of the <i>raïta</i> of some rival establishment.
Away in the dancing girls’ quarter the gaiety continues until the
Arab policeman, blowing on his trumpet, sends all the Faithful to
bed, for the most part under the bright stars.</p>

<p>At dawn the city is astir, the coffee-houses are again open, and
the shepherds are gathering about the <i>fondouks</i>, where they
have lodged their animals for the night. The more thrifty, who have
preferred to sleep out on the plains with their flocks rather than
pay lodging to the <i>fondouk</i> keeper, are already on the
market-place, a broad open area clear of the city.</p>

<p>There are twenty thousand ewes and as many lambs to be sold
to-day. It is an amazing sight to see hundreds of flocks herded
together, with here and there a black patch where stand the goats.
A little apart from the sheep is the donkey market—poor little
beasts blinking patiently in the sun, while a little farther on the
camels groan and gurgle as if they resented being vulgarly disposed
of in a sheep-market.</p>

<p>All the Arab chiefs and the Frenchmen from the hotel are there
moving about the flocks, looking at teeth, examining fleeces,
feeling backs. Prices which during the early hours have been
unstable, settle down toward seven, and the serious buying begins.
The sun rises up in the heavens and blazes down on the great
concourse of white-robed shepherds. Then gradually as the purchases
are completed, the various buyers separate their lots from the
general herd and drive them into different groups away from the
main market.</p>

<p>And now there is a flow of people in the opposite direction, the
sellers are being paid, the cafés are<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_251">[251]</span> filling up again, the more thrifty are
investing their money in barley or clothes, the generous are
purchasing scarfs for their women. As the afternoon draws on, the
caravans begin reforming and moving off across the great plain,
little groups of sheep and camels can be seen following the long
straight tracks. By sunset the town has once more dwindled to its
normal population, the coffee-sellers and the Mzabite grocers are
counting their profits, and flute players and dancing girls have
retired to rest, and quiet reigns till the next market-day.</p>

<p>But though all this is picturesque and interesting and unusual,
the European used to average comfort is glad to see the last of the
gray <i>diligence</i> as he is deposited at the nearest railway
station, and he sinks back with a sigh of relief on the soft
cushions of the first-class railway carriage.</p>

</p>

<h2><a id="c38"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br>
<span class="sc2">A FEW SKETCHES OF ARAB LIFE</span></h2>

<h3>1. <em>Summer in the Sahara</em></h3>

<p><span class="sc">Having</span> now endeavored to give the reader
a general idea of Algeria from all points of view, I propose to
close this book with a few sketches of my life among the Arabs.</p>

<p>There is nothing particularly striking about these experiences,
but I feel they will lift a further veil on the inner life of these
people whose privacy it is so difficult to penetrate. Only years of
contact have opened the innermost doors of their homes, only the
word of some intimate friend telling of the fellowship between the
lone Englishman and the people of Algeria has removed all
suspicious constraint, only the reputation of simplicity and the
instinct of caste has brought them to me with all their ideas laid
bare.</p>

<p>However, before describing these scenes I would like the reader
to catch a glimpse of the country in a clothing different from that
thrown on the screen by the Circuits Transatlantiques. The average
traveler will have fled the shores of North Africa before the first
months of summer, when the big hotels in Algiers have closed their
shutters and the syncopated saxophonists have packed up their
greasy dinner-jackets and crossed to cooler climes. The hot weather
in Algiers itself is singularly unpleasant, not so much from the
point of view of temperature, which never rises very high, but
because of the damp. It is like living in a steam bath all day, and
correspondingly tiring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
</p>

<p>Once in the plains of the Mitidja, however, or up in the hills,
the heat is greater but the air is dry, and provided one keeps
quiet in the middle of the day one can quite well bear the summer
months. The temperature of the Sahara is high, but the heat, being
very dry, is not too unpleasant, and though it is not recommended
to pass July and August in an oasis it is no real hardship for the
young and healthy once in a while.</p>

<p>In the first place houses are built to protect one from the sun;
very thick mud walls plastered over, which do not attract the heat,
outside verandahs or inner courts open to the sky, and heavy
shutters, make it possible to keep the house comparatively cool
during the middle hours of the day. Life too is organized to meet
the requirements of the weather. All business is contracted between
six and ten. At eleven everything closes, including the
post-office, and remains shut until three. During these hours lunch
is eaten, followed by the siesta, and it is not until four that
those who are not forced to, appear. By five the main street
presents an animated aspect of Arabs strolling up and down in their
white robes, while the cafés begin to fill up. Those who have
gardens in the oasis repair to them and work until friends arrive
to pay calls and discuss the produce of the rich soil over cups of
mint tea, while in a secluded corner the women squat with the
children and gossip in whispers.</p>

<p>Sometimes an Arab of importance will give a dinner in his
garden. A carpet is spread out on the ground, a brass tray is
placed in the middle, while near-by the sheep is being roasted
whole on a brushwood fire. A flutist or a guitarist will play under
the orange-trees by the light of the summer moon. The diners will
often remain on the carpet the whole night and return direct to
their business in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
</p>

<p>These gardens are worthy of note. They are not usually anywhere
near the residence of the owner, who lives in the town; they vary
in size from three acres to half an acre, and are planted with
fruit-trees and vegetables, which grow in astonishing abundance. In
fact, with the exception of the dates, the oranges and the
apricots, all the fruit can not be disposed of. It is a wonderful
sight to see gardens full of pears and apricots and figs and
strawberries and pomegranates, while vines heavy with grapes climb
up the walls and the tall date-palms nod in the warm breeze,
protecting the garden from the fiercest rays of the midday sun.</p>

<p>In the terrible months of July and August one wonders why the
leaves of the trees do not shrivel up under the fiery rays of the
summer sun. But on the other hand it must be remembered that all is
a matter of contrast and that during the midwinter months, when the
temperature is that of April in England, it is cold for the Sahara
vegetation, and trees are as leafless as those at home in the same
period. In fact, vegetation on the Riviera in winter is infinitely
more abundant than on the edge of the Sahara at the same
season.</p>

<p>The desert too, like the gardens of the oasis, presents a
totally different aspect in summer from that which might be
supposed. Whereas this heat transferred to England would burn up
every blade of grass, here it brings to the surface all kinds of
scrub vegetation, and standing on an eminence looking over the
northern tracts of the Sahara, the view presents a greener
impression than to the tourist in winter. The nights too are
comparatively cool, and a blanket is sometimes required after
midnight when the stony land has cooled and when the house is
storing up all the fresh air before the hermetic closing of all
windows at sunrise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
</p>

<p>If, therefore, those who stay all the summer will mind the
precepts of all hot countries, a reverential respect for the sun, a
light diet and abstinence from alcohol, they will not suffer too
much, provided the experience is not repeated too often.</p>

<p>The flies are tiresome, but there is little disease, and except
during famine years the typhus does not appear. The sun is a
marvelous disinfectant, and the mortality in these southern cities
is very low.</p>

<p>But when the sirocco starts blowing it is a very different
story. It always comes in series of three, six, nine days, and it
usually rises at dawn. There is no mistaking it. Peacefully asleep,
one suddenly awakes to the rattle of shutters and a sensation that
one’s hair is being scorched on one’s head. Every one is up
immediately, closing every window to keep in a little freshness.
The day is terrible; standing in front of a furnace in a glass
factory is the only comparison possible, intensified by great
clouds of whirling sand which come sweeping across the desert and
which drive on for miles, shrouding the sun in a kind of yellow
cloak and creeping even into one’s innermost chamber as one tries
in vain to keep out of the heat.</p>

<p>But apart from the ordeal of sirocco days a man sensibly dressed
and living a reasonable life in an oasis of the Sahara, with an
average shade temperature of one hundred degrees is better off than
the tall-hatted Londoner devouring his copious British lunch and
not resting in the middle of the day, and the tourist who will
venture south in June will return home with a marvelous impression
of real summer.</p>

<h3>2. <em>Staying in a Country House in the Tell</em></h3>

<p>Staying in an Arab country house is as different from staying in
a country house in Europe as it is possible<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_256">[256]</span> to imagine. (I am speaking, of course,
from the point of view of intimate friends who are treated as the
Arabs.)</p>

<p>In the first place there is no specific invitation; one is asked
to come and stay, say in the summer, and when one feels inclined,
one arrives. If one is polite one wires beforehand, but it is not
expected. Secondly, one goes always with some specific object—to
shoot, to visit flocks, to contract some business in the
neighborhood, but rarely just to stay.</p>

<p>When one arrives the host may or may not be there; if he is not
he will have delegated some near relation to do the honors in his
place, and he may appear during the course of the visit. In the
same way he may suddenly go away when one has only been there a few
days, but it does not in the least suggest a hint for the guest to
leave; a deputy host will take his place and things will go on in
exactly the same way.</p>

<p>Another thing in an Arab home, which is quite peculiar to the
country, is the fact that the guests not of the actual family
neither eat nor sleep in the house in which the people live, that
is to say that there is a kind of guest annex which is only opened
on these occasions. This custom is chiefly due to the presence of
the women, who might be difficult to conceal from strangers if they
had access to the main building.</p>

<p>The particular country house I am going to describe belongs to a
<i>bash agha</i> and is situated in the Tellian Atlas near to the
village of Bourbaki. The country is mountainous and produces
cereals.</p>

<p>I arrived two days late for my visit, but not at all through my
fault, as I had arranged to go by train to Boghari, where my host
would send me a car. I arrived at the specified time, but the
conveyance did not come for forty-eight hours. I naturally
expressed astonishment and some annoyance, but it seemed
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span> surprise the
driver, to whom a day or so before or after meant so little.</p>

<p>When I arrived, dinner awaited me, and I was pleased to see that
I was being treated really as one of the family, and that there
were no tables or chairs, no knives and forks. The party was
assembled in a pillared courtyard open to the sky, with jasmine and
rose bushes growing around. Two lemon-trees stood at either end,
and above us a July moon shed a gentle radiance.</p>

<p>We sat down in three circles. In the first group was the <i>bash
agha</i>, myself, my <i>caïd</i> partner of the sheep farm, an old
schoolmaster and a very aged <i>imam</i>. In the second group were
the <i>bash agha’s</i> sons, his nephews, and his chief clerk. In
the third group were my head shepherd, the chauffeur, and the rest
of the retainers.</p>

<p>The food was first of all placed in the center of our circle,
and we all dipped into the common bowl: when we had had enough it
was passed to the second circle, who did likewise, until it was
finished by the third party. While the third group was eating we
began our next course, and the servant was able to join the last
group.</p>

<p>“Servant” is not exactly the right word, as <i>“khedime,”</i>
which is literally translated by “servant,” is almost a term of
insult. The people who wait and look after the house of an Arab
chief are not considered in the same way as those who minister to
us. In the first place they are not paid, but are merely clothed
and lodged—they and their families, and when they get too old they
are kept on and their sons take their places for the actual
work.</p>

<p>When dinner was over and we had washed our faces and hands and
tea and coffee had been brought, we stretched out our legs on the
carpet. While we in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
our little circle began to smoke, the other groups broke up and
moved silently out of the court, for in the presence of their
elders they could not light a cigarette; in fact, during the whole
of the meal they had conducted their conversation in respectful
whispers.</p>

<p>For an hour or so we sat and conversed on all kinds of subjects,
then one by one the Arabs dropped off into a doze, no constraint,
no endeavoring to keep awake when sleep dominated. For a while they
slumbered, then, coming to again, said good night and went off to
the other part of the house to rest, while I settled myself in the
vast guest-chamber in a large brass bed.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night there was an earthquake. It did not
last very long, but for a moment the house shook violently. The
household rose in commotion, and the <i>bash agha</i> came rushing
into my room fully dressed, which proved to me again that these men
sleep in their clothes. He looked at me in surprise.</p>

<p>“How is this,” he cried, “an earthquake and you remain in bed
without moving?”</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>“It is I who should be surprised,” I replied, “for with your
belief in the <i>mektoub</i> you shouldn’t worry about such trifles
as earthquakes.”</p>

<p>His eyes twinkled in spite of his emotion.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he said, “what is written is written, and none
but Allah can interfere. Good rest!”</p>

<p>He left me and I heard him outside admonishing the others for
making such a noise.</p>

<p>The next day we motored up to see some of the <i>bash agha’s</i>
cattle in the cedar forest near Teniet el Haad. This is one of the
finest excursions in Algeria, but it is unfortunately off the
tourist track, and practically no one goes there.</p>

<p>It is, however, quite a simple journey, and if the traveler
wishes to see real forest he has but to motor<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_259">[259]</span> from Algiers, either via Tipaza and
Miliana, which is in itself a gorgeous drive, and continue to the
south by Boghari, or else he can return to Algiers by Goghari and
Medea. If he does not have a car he can take the train to
Affreville, where an excellent motor-bus will land him at Teniet el
Haad. Here there is quite a good hotel of the unluxurious type.</p>

<p>The cedar forest is in the mountains some fourteen kilometers
along a quite passable mountain road. It winds steeply up through
pine-trees, then little by little the cedars begin to appear
standing erect, their long arms stretched out forming roofs of that
delicate blue-green. As one progresses the cedar alone remains,
increasing in size until one comes upon giant trees a hundred feet
high and with a circumference of seven or eight yards. The view
over the valleys below is superb.</p>

<p>We stopped at a clearing where the <i>bash agha</i> kept a small
house, and we went in search of the cows. It took some time to find
them, but during our walk we passed some really magnificent
trees—giants, centuries old. On our return to the house I was
surprised to find, instead of the cold chicken and beef associated
with picnics in the mountains, a five-course hot lunch with the
best wine of Algeria.</p>

<p>The <i>bash agha</i> explained that he always kept all material
ready in his chalet, and that it only needed the bringing of the
food to have it prepared. As a matter of fact I have always noticed
with Arabs that in the question of meals there are no
half-measures. One either spends the whole day out with nothing
except perhaps a piece of bread, or else one sits down to a feast
in the most out-of-the-way place.</p>

<p>The meal was excellent, too excellent, with the result that we
all went to sleep after. When we woke up it was late afternoon and
the sun was glinting through<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_260">[260]</span> the blue branches of the cedars and
lighting up the forest in a fairy fashion. One expected to see
gnomes and elves appear from out of the vast trunks. We drove back
in the sunset, the softest light imaginable, but quite unlike the
golden radiance of the Sahara.</p>

<p>The following day was market-day at Burdeau, some thirty
kilometers away, so that every one was astir at dawn, and before
sunrise every male member of the household had piled into the cars
and we were speeding across the cereal plain which overlooks the
Sersou. All the <i>aghas</i> and <i>caïds</i> of the district as
well as those from the south were there, and there was much kissing
and shaking of hands.</p>

<p>I saw here another curious example of the respect of the younger
generation for the older. I wanted my breakfast, so I went into a
café with the <i>caïd</i>; my partner and I ordered our coffee. It
was just being brought when up jumped the <i>caïd</i> and went off
into the street. I followed anxiously, and to my surprise he went
into the café opposite, where he ordered the same collation. This
time it was actually brought and set on the table, when like a
flash my companion was up again and outside before I could
speak.</p>

<p>I caught him up and saw that he was making for the original
café.</p>

<p>“Hi!” I cried, “what’s all this about? Is it a game? Why can’t
we eat in peace? I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you notice?” he asked calmly.</p>

<p>“Notice what?” I asked.</p>

<p>“My uncle, the <i>bash agha</i> of the Larbas.”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t say I did,” I replied, “but what of it?”</p>

<p>“He came into the first café when I was sitting there, and I
couldn’t remain; and then just as I had settled in the next, he
came in there too.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose we shall go on chasing round Burdeau till the old
gentleman settles or until we die<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_261">[261]</span> of hunger,” I laughed back. “No, <i>mon
vieux</i>, I’m hungry, and I won’t starve for any one.”</p>

<p>So saying I took my coffee and roll and carried it across to the
<i>bash agha’s</i> table, where I sat down and explained my action.
He smiled, but I realized that he was smiling to please me, and
that he saw nothing in the inconvenience caused to his nephew, who
might wait all day for his coffee if necessary.</p>

<p>On the way back we called on various <i>caïds</i> and rich
farmers, who gave us quantities of sweet mint tea. At one house the
old <i>bash agha</i>, who had accompanied us, found an aged
<i>kadi</i> who played chess, so he insisted on having a game while
we all had to wait, regardless of the fact that it was getting near
dinner-time.</p>

<p>How different from the customs of Europe, where age is, if
anything, jeered at. Fancy giving a lift to some one’s grandfather
after a day in the country and having to wait while he played a
silly game with a local judge whom he met in some one else’s
house!</p>

<p>And so the pleasant visit wore on. Each day we did something
different, each day we had enormous meals until finally I was
obliged to leave. Looking back on the visit the thing which strikes
me the most is the complete lack of fuss during the whole of my
stay. Everything was done quite haphazardly and yet without a
hitch. I suppose it is the effect of centuries of such existence
which remains as a background and which is carried on generation
after generation. A few modern inventions have appeared which
facilitate things a bit, but otherwise the same life is led with
exactly the same ideas as it was twelve hundred years ago, and it
seems difficult to see any radical change ever taking place. In
this mode life runs smoothly for the Arabs; complications do not
trouble them, so why change?</p>

<h3>3. <em>A Week-end with a Marabout</em></h3>

<p>The Marabout of Kourdane asked me to spend a week-end with him
to discuss the possibilities of organizing a moufflon shoot in the
Djbel Amour. I was interested in the prospects of getting a
moufflon, but still more interested to see Kourdane.</p>

<p>Situated in the Sahara some fifty kilometers from Laghouat, at
the foot of the Djebel Amour Range, this country home of
<i>marabouts</i> was created by a Frenchwoman known as Madame
Aurélie, whose maiden name was Aurélie Picard, the daughter of a
gendarme. She had met the Marabout of Aïn Mahdi at Bordeaux when he
had been exiled during the insurrection of 1870. She married him in
France, and when he was allowed to return to Algeria she came too,
and became a great personage in the country. At his death she
married his brother, and continued as lady of this desolate area,
loved and respected by all. Finally the second husband died too,
and she remained on alone for a while in the wonderful house she
had built. She is still alive, but she rarely returns to the scenes
of her greatness for two reasons; in the first place, the present
<i>marabouts</i> are not quite the saints they should be, and
secondly, they are all a little jealous of her reputation.</p>

<p>As I had never seen this desert castle I accepted with alacrity,
and left with a friend one Saturday morning in a car. The road on
leaving Laghouat is to the north, but soon it turns southwest
across a desolate land of sand and rocks. I had decided to lunch
with an old friend of mine, the Caïd of Tadgemout. I reached the
<i>ksar</i> at noon: a sad, desolate little village partly in
ruins, perched on the top of a rocky eminence overlooking a small
oasis, very green in the midst of the desert. The road climbed up
behind the rock and emerged before the <i>caïd’s</i> house, which
dominates the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
oasis. The view from his terrace is one of the most impressive in
these parts. In the immediate foreground, the oasis, then a silver
thread of water running down the river-bed and away, away, the
desert. But unlike most of the Saharan views the horizon is cut all
of a sudden by a group of rugged hills standing up grim and bare.
Again, looking to the northwest the scene is not at all expected,
as one’s eyes rest on the great range of the Djebel Amour, deep
blue against the brilliant sky.</p>

<p>Tadgemout is said to mean the “Crown of Death,” and was the
capital of a desert queen whose every punishment even for the
smallest crime was death. It is a place which grows upon one, and
one is loath to leave its lonely site.</p>

<p>The <i>caïd</i> himself is a charming person, far superior to
most of his kind, both in intelligence and manners. This is partly
due to his own efforts and also to the fact that during the war he
was made prisoner and, being eventually exchanged as an invalid,
spent a long time in Switzerland, where he attended lectures at
Geneva University and came in contact with all kinds of people. He
received us before his door and led us into the guest-house where
one of those interminable repasts was prepared. We discussed all
manners of extraordinary subjects, or rather I was subjected to a
series of endless questions, as the <i>caïd</i> is of an
inquisitive turn of mind. One remark is worthy of note as showing
the curious working of an Oriental brain.</p>

<p>He suddenly said:</p>

<p>“Why don’t Protestant clergymen wear vestments like the
Catholics?”</p>

<p>I began with a dissertation on the Reformation, but he knew all
about that.</p>

<p>After lunch he accompanied us on our journey. The road dipped
down into a dried river-bed, where<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_264">[264]</span> the car stuck; we all had to climb out and
push; no comment was made, as this is one of the most usual
occurrences when motoring across the Sahara. The road continued
desolate as we drew near to the blue mountains.</p>

<p>Suddenly a great block of buildings stood out of the wasted
land; a garden covering at least a square mile surrounded it,
making a wonderful contrast of green.</p>

<p>“Kourdane,” replied my companion to my inquiry; “the house built
by Madame Aurélie; the garden created by her with water from many
wells; everything done on the most lavish scale and now hardly
appreciated by her descendants.”</p>

<p>Indeed, as we approached the wide portal of the outer wall, I
noticed that the building had not been whitewashed for years and
that the plaster was peeling off. Fissures had appeared, and though
the mass of the edifice struck one forcibly after the usual
one-storied Arab houses, I realized that we were in a splendor of
the past.</p>

<p>The <i>marabout</i> hurried out to greet us. Small of stature,
with decidedly negro features, his general appearance on first
contact was not impressive. And yet as one watched him one realized
a kind of superiority engrained by many generations of domination.
My <i>caïd</i> kissed his hand, the chauffeur kissed his hand and
his head; the young man took it all as calmly as the hand-shake I
gave him. He led us along the side of the house to the front and
here, of a sudden, one was transported out of any sort of Arab
setting. Instead of the usual small doorway leading to some dim
ante-chamber or narrow staircase, we came upon a great flagged
space interspersed with flower-beds and fountains and rivulets,
while tall cypresses grew about, protecting the garden from the
desert winds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
</p>

<p>A broad staircase built of rosy stone led up to a terrace
pillared and tiled in delicate shades, giving an impression of
majesty, of far-away power, of magnificence. We mounted the
stairway and were led into a dining-room quite simple in spite of
its size, and then into a drawing-room. An array of superb Arab
furniture filled the room, not the tawdry tables and chairs bought
in Algiers, but the real work of the country: chests of drawers,
cupboards, brackets inlaid with mother-of-pearl, priceless carpets
on the floor, and lovely hangings over the doors; swords and
daggers of all periods festooned the walls. We passed out of the
drawing-room on to a gallery running all the length of the
building, and on to which opened the guestrooms. As we entered the
first, I was struck by the richness of the setting, by the real
Arab bed hung about with brocaded curtains, then I realized that I
was not in one room but in a series. I turned in surprise to the
<i>caïd</i>. He smiled at my astonishment and explained that at
Kourdane every guest had his private suite—bedroom, sitting-room,
dining-room—and that in the old days of the Great Marabout meals
were sent separately to each person who spent the night there. The
importance of the repast varied according to the standing of the
guest, but great or small, he was waited on in his own apartment.
Afterward every one met in the drawing-room for coffee.</p>

<p>“Even now,” he added, “we shall dine in the dining-room without
our host, who will be served apart.”</p>

<p>I could find nothing to say; the old baronial hall of the Middle
Ages with the high table seemed eclipsed.</p>

<p>We returned to the garden and were led with reverence to the
tomb of the <i>marabout</i>. It was built round an ancient tree
under which he was wont to take his afternoon sleep. A light burned
perpetually there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
</p>

<p>We visited the domain, and the richness of the vast garden in
the middle of the desolate land was almost as impressive as the
pomp of the house.</p>

<p>At seven-thirty we dined, and as the <i>caïd</i> had predicted,
our meal was partaken without the host. There was a sheep roasted
whole, with one of the best Bordeaux wines I had tasted for a long
time. Afterward the little <i>marabout</i> came in and took his
coffee with us in the gorgeous drawing-room. We talked for a while
about shooting and then, turning toward a battered piano,
contrasting sadly with the rest of the furnishings, he asked if any
one could play. My English companion was persuaded to approach the
keyboard. The holy atmosphere inspired him to play Nazareth, but
the sounds evoked from the yellow notes were so unexpected that he
swiftly changed into a Waldteufel waltz, though it did not sound at
all like the tune I knew. However, this did not in the least
matter, and the Arabs sat spellbound as the unspeakable discords
burst from the instrument which had not been tuned for fifty
years.</p>

<p>Finally the party broke up and we retired to our respective
apartments in an atmosphere of decadent grandeur. During the night
I was awakened by the casements rattling, and though I tried to
turn over and sleep again, I knew instinctively what it meant. As
soon as I was called I walked out on to the terrace and at once
realized that my intuition was right. A fierce wind was blowing up
from the southeast and clouds of sand and dust were whirling across
the desert. As the day increased the wind rose and the sand which
had merely been coming in gusts became a cloud which swept across
the land, enveloping all.</p>

<p>The sun tried to pierce the pall of dust, but little by little
it was obliterated and the atmosphere became that of a sea mist
mixed up with a London fog. Dust,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_267">[267]</span> sand, grit filtered its way in everywhere
while the wind roared through the cypress trees and about the
house. By lunch-time the sand-storm was at its height and the light
of day was no brighter than at dusk. We had, however, promised to
go over to Aïn Mahdi, a few miles farther on, and visit the head
<i>marabout</i>. We rolled ourselves in burnouses, wrapped our
heads in <i>chechs</i>, and started off in the car. The Djebel
Amour was quite obscured, and the whirling sand stung our faces,
while above, miles above it seemed, the great yellow cloud swept
on.</p>

<p>Aïn Mahdi is a holy city, walled and fortified, which lies at
the western end of the Djebel Amour. Built about the eleventh
century it used to be a university town and a city of great
learning, where some of the most valuable manuscripts were
produced. During the middle of the last century the holy order of
the Tidjanis was founded and took up its headquarters here. The
Tidjanis have branches all over the Moslem world, which explains
the riches of Kourdane, as well as the great fortune of the old
gentleman we were going to see. All the members of these branches
send their yearly offering to the seat of their order, and the
annual revenue of the <i>marabout’s</i> family probably exceeds any
income in the world.</p>

<p>We passed in through a square archway and stopped in front of
two fine old doors standing at right angles to one another in the
corner of a small square. The first was the mosque, the second the
<i>zaouia</i>. Taking off our shoes we entered the mosque. Built on
old foundations, the present structure is only some hundred years
old, but it is exceedingly picturesque. A courtyard with tall trees
growing in the middle first meets the eye; at the foot of the
opposite wall is an old bronze cannon captured from Abd-el-Kader,
who besieged the holy city in 1838.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
</p>

<p>Turning to the left, we entered the shrine, small and dim, but
which nevertheless disclosed some lovely green tiles lining the
walls. On the floor were beautiful carpets, while banners of the
saints hung from the graceful arches. On the far side a dark mass,
suggesting a catafalque, with glints of gold and silver and
precious stones, draped about with costly stuffs, could be seen,
and under it the tomb of the Great Marabout, founder of the
order.</p>

<p>On leaving the mosque we went to the <i>marabout’s</i> house and
were received by his son, a very strong negroid type, but always
with that look of self-assurance, that almost regal presence. He
could not have been more than twenty, but he held out his hand to
be kissed as if he ruled the world.</p>

<p>His house was clean but modern, and after eating cakes and
drinking sweet tea we took a walk through the town. Unlike most of
the oasis villages it is built entirely of stone, and though the
houses might be in a better state of repair, it gives a more solid
impression than the usual mud streets. Another most striking thing
is that the women not of <i>maraboutic</i> blood all go about
unveiled, and the marriages are not arranged as in ordinary
Mohammedan centers—by the parents— but the young men are allowed to
court the ladies of their choice, who are at liberty to refuse
their suitors. The female descendants of the <i>marabouts</i> are,
on the contrary, veiled at the age of eight, and never unveil until
they die.</p>

<p>My companion of Tadgemout took us to visit his uncle, the Caïd
of Aïn Mahdi, who again plied us with tea; from there we progressed
to the house of another <i>marabout</i>, and so on until we were so
saturated in mint and tea and coffee that we could hardly walk, and
we had practically no time to visit the looms where they weave the
famous blue and red carpets of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_269">[269]</span> the Djebel Amour. However, the day was
drawing on, and we had to think of returning to Kourdane, so,
accompanied by a host of <i>marabouts</i> of all ages we reached
our car, where the accolades and hugs rebegan. One felt as if one
had stepped right back hundreds and hundreds of years into some
scene of the past, and indeed it might have been so, for the life
of these people has not changed in the least degree since the days
of the foundation of the city, when King Harold sat on the throne
of Britain and William the Conqueror cast longing glances across
the channel.</p>

<p>Armor, trunk-hose, laces, curls, ruffles, knee-breeches,
pantaloons, tall hats, have come into fashion and disappeared in
England since those days, but to the children of Aïn Mahdi it has
never occurred to dress otherwise than in a <i>gandourah</i> and
burnous, and I don’t suppose that it ever will.</p>

<p>When we left the gates of the city the wind had dropped, but the
sand still hung like a great pall over the land, just as when a
dust is raised in a room it hangs in the air for some time before
settling. Our visit was almost over, and next morning we took leave
of our hospitable little host, and returned to Laghouat, realizing
that we had had an experience which would last long in our
minds.</p>

<h3>4. <em>A Day’s Fishing in Southern Algeria</em></h3>

<p>Jelloul ben Lahkdar, <i>bash agha</i> of the Larba tribe about
the oasis of Laghouat, is a man with the presence of an emperor,
and when I meet him I feel that I ought to kneel down and kiss his
hand.</p>

<p>I do not do this, however, partly because it would be
misconstrued, and partly because the <i>bash agha</i> is a charming
old gentleman with a sense of humor, and one whose soul is
simplicity itself. He is rather a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_270">[270]</span> tyrant with the younger members of his
family, and I know that they are very frightened of him, and that
they are like young schoolboys when he is with them.</p>

<p>However, this does not prevent his being a very entertaining
companion, and though he rarely maintains a lengthy conversation,
what he says is wise and to the point. When I met him, therefore,
in Chellala, a little market-town nestling among the hills some two
hundred miles north of the Sahara, I was delighted.</p>

<p>“Why, what are you doing here, <i>bash agha</i>?” I exclaimed,
after we had passed through the lengthy Arab greeting which is very
poetical but rather tedious in the long run.</p>

<p>“I have taken up my summer quarters with the Caïd Ali, my
cousin,” he replied. “And you, my friend?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve just come up for the sheep-market.”</p>

<p>“You dine with us to-night,” he went on, “you will taste some
fish.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I replied, “it will be a pleasure to dine at your
hospitable table and a luxury to eat fish from the sea.”</p>

<p>“They do not come from the sea,” he replied. “They are fish from
the river at Taguine, forty kilometers from here.”</p>

<p>“Freshwater fish,” I exclaimed. “I have lived in this country
long, but I did not know such things existed in Algeria!”</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>“Come and see,” he went on, and, patting my arm, continued his
stately promenade down the road.</p>

<p>I went and found a party of Arab chiefs I knew. More solemn
greetings. At the beginning of the long meal the fish was served.
There was no doubt about it, they were good-sized river-fish, a
kind of carp or perch or gudgeon with little taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
</p>

<p>The <i>bash agha</i> smiled at my surprise.</p>

<p>“Would you care to fish them yourself?” he enquired.</p>

<p>“Most certainly,” I replied, “but I have no rod or line with
me.”</p>

<p>“I am going to Taguine to-morrow,” he went on, “and if you come
here at eight I will give you a lift, and you can lunch there with
me. I’ll see that you are supplied with rods and lines.”</p>

<p>I thanked him warmly, wondering in myself what the fishing could
be like.</p>

<p>The next morning a <i>cavalier</i> or Arab retainer came round
and, entering my room, roused me from my slumbers by telling me
that the <i>bash agha</i> awaited me.</p>

<p>I bounded from my bed and looked out of the window at the clock
on the Administrateur’s office, but it said only seven. I pointed
this out to the <i>cavalier</i> and explained that I had been
warned for eight. He did not seem in the least impressed, and only
repeated the information that the <i>bash agha</i> awaited me. I
gathered that he expected me to run down in my pajamas. Arabs
rarely undress, and wash only at the Turkish bath and at meals, and
they can not understand that a European can’t walk straight out of
his bed to his daily duties.</p>

<p>I failed to convey any of this to the <i>cavalier</i>, and he
left me, repeating that the <i>bash agha</i> awaited me.</p>

<p>At seven-thirty the Caïd Madani came into my room and, after
passing through the ritual of early morning salutations, informed
me that the <i>bash agha</i> awaited me.</p>

<p>I said, “But he warned me for eight, and it is only
seven-thirty.”</p>

<p>He said, “But the <i>bash agha</i> is ready.”</p>

<p>I said, “Well, he ought to have told me to come earlier.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
</p>

<p>The <i>caïd</i> did not seem to understand my point of view, and
only replied, “Well, perhaps you will hurry; I will wait
down-stairs.”</p>

<p>I hurried, and eventually dashed out, followed by my companion,
to where the car waited. The <i>bash agha</i> sat in a chair and
smoked a meerschaum pipe. He was surrounded by a group of Arab
chiefs.</p>

<p>“What respect,” I said to myself. “The old man goes out for the
day and all the chiefs come to see him off.”</p>

<p>The <i>bash agha</i> saluted me and made no reference to the
hour of our departure. I felt relieved.</p>

<p>His chauffeur got into the car, the old gentleman got in beside
him. The Caïd Madani motioned me to get in behind, the Caïd Madani
got in after me, the Caïd Aïssa got in after the Caïd Madani, the
Sheik Marhoun got in after the Caïd Aïssa, the <i>kadi</i> got in
after the Sheik Marhoun. The Caïd Ali said, “I don’t think I shall
come, there isn’t much room left.”</p>

<p>All the others protested, so he got in too.</p>

<p>The Caïd Mohamed categorically refused to make a ninth.</p>

<p>The <i>bash agha</i> turned round and said, “Well, I think we
are all here. Let us start.”</p>

<p>The car moved off. At the entrance of the town the Sheik Marhoun
said, “Do you think that we’ve got enough petrol to get there and
back?”</p>

<p><i>“Inch Allah,”</i> replied the chauffeur.</p>

<p>The <i>kadi</i>, who is a practical man, and who likes his
comforts, interposed, “I think you had better make certain.”</p>

<p>The chauffeur made certain and found there was enough to do
about one mile down hill.</p>

<p>We therefore returned to the town to get some. No one seemed to
mind, though; my seven Arabs made no comment and remained as placid
as if the filling of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_273">[273]</span> the petrol tank was merely a childish whim
of the <i>kadi</i>. I felt certain that they were saying to
themselves, “If the car lacks fuel, Allah will surely provide.”</p>

<p>I said to the <i>kadi</i>, “Lucky you thought of asking.”</p>

<p>He smiled benignly. I love the <i>kadi</i>. He is a charming
person. He is the Mohammedan Judge of Chellala, and he looks like
an early Victorian Englishman: fair beard, very white skin, a
slightly rubicund nose, clear blue eyes, and long white hands. If
he wore a pair of nankeen pantaloons and a choker instead of a
burnous and a turban, he would be the image of what Alfred de
Musset must have been in his prime. The <i>kadi</i> has, moreover,
a great sense of humor.</p>

<p>When we had filled up, we rolled off first of all through the
mountains of Chellala and then on to the great open plains which
run down to the Sahara, forming some of the finest pasture-land of
Algeria.</p>

<p>My companions all chatted away to each other about their
sheep-raising, their crops, their horses, their falcons, their
shooting—all those things so dear to these country gentlemen.</p>

<p>Occasionally they poked fun at the <i>kadi</i>, who is not a
warrior nor a sportsman, but he always had a sharp retort which
sent them into helpless laughter.</p>

<p>Finally we arrived at Taguine and stopped for a moment at the
monument which marks the place where the Duc d’Aumale’s flying
column captured the whole of the Emir-el-Kader’s <i>smala</i> in
1843 and thus broke his long resistance.</p>

<p>This was an occasion to rain more jokes on the <i>kadi’s</i>
head, as he is a direct descendant of the great <i>emir</i>, and it
was the great-uncle of the Caïd Aïssa, the loyal General Yusuf, who
was in command of the native cavalry on this occasion.</p>

<p>As soon as we alighted, the various chiefs had business to
attend to, and I was despatched to fish.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_274">[274]</span> I was furnished with a long pole, on the
end of which was a piece of thin rope to which was further riveted
a hook. There was also a box of worms.</p>

<p>My guide was an ex-soldier dressed in a tattered burnous on
which was proudly pinned the Croix de Guerre, and under which he
wore a seedy frock coat with satin facings. He had no socks, but a
pair of very battered slippers.</p>

<p>After trudging through the fields of standing barley for about
half an hour we came to a kind of brown ditch with a rivulet one
yard broad trickling sadly down the middle.</p>

<p>“Here is the river,” said the guide proudly.</p>

<p>I said nothing, but looked anxiously into the trickle, but all I
could see were five or six tortoises paddling about. Eton days when
I kept these beasts in a biscuit box in the wash-stand, hidden from
the eagle eyes of m’tutor, returned to me, but I somehow did not
connect them with rods and hooks.</p>

<p>My companion seemed to read my thoughts. “The fish are further
on,” he said simply; “come!”</p>

<p>I followed him along the bank and eventually we came to a deep,
muddy pool about twenty feet square. The Arab squatted down,
knotted a cork into the middle of the rope, baited my hook and
handed me the pole. I took it and felt inclined to laugh. It
reminded me of that stupid Christmas game where one fishes for
useless presents out of a tub. However, I lowered the worm into the
opaque water and waited. Two minutes had hardly passed when down
went the cork. Instinctively I struck. Memories of sudden thrills
by tumbling streams, the hiss of a line running out, the bend of
the rod, flashed before me. But they were only visions, for I had
struck so violently, and the string or cable at the end of my pole
was so strong, that I jerked the fish right out of the pool and on
to the bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
</p>

<p>My fisherman instantly rescued it from the hook and I took it up
to examine it. I expected to find the mud-fish which I had often
come across in certain Indian rivers; but not at all. In shape it
resembled a perch, but though the fins were red, there were none of
the sharp points on the back, and the color was more that of a
carp. Its weight was about two ounces.</p>

<p>I continued fishing. We visited some three or four pools, and in
two hours I caught nearly one hundred of these fish. The majority
were like the first, but there were a dozen or so of over a quarter
of a pound, and two must have weighed a good twelve ounces.</p>

<p>Finally surfeited with this somewhat crane-like occupation, I
trudged back.</p>

<p>Clouds were banking up over there toward the north, and the Arab
watched them with interest.</p>

<p>“Two days, rain now, <i>sidi</i>,” he exclaimed, “will double
our crops and afford pasturage for the flocks for the rest of the
summer.”</p>

<p>I reached the house of the Caïd Aïssa to find my friends all
sitting in a circle on a priceless Djebel Amour carpet, and looking
hungrily out of the door where four Arabs turned a sheep spitted on
a long pole before a brushwood fire. The sheep was becoming a
glorious golden color as the chief turnspit poured fat on its
roasting sides. After my long walk the smell of this cooking meat
roused my appetite.</p>

<p>I slipped off my shoes and went and sat down on a cushion beside
the <i>bash agha</i>. I told him all about my fishing exploits, but
he didn’t seem to take the least interest in my tale. He merely
turned to me and said: “These foolish young men have brought you
out to lunch here and they have forgotten to bring knives or forks
or plates, so you will have to eat like us.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I replied, rather nervously, “I consider that eating with
one’s hands is much more cleanly<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_276">[276]</span> than using knives and forks which may not
have been washed.”</p>

<p>The <i>bash agha</i> grunted and the others looked anxiously
about. I realized that the old man was in one of his tyrannical
moods.</p>

<p>At last one of the cooks came in and demanded if he should
serve.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the <i>bash agha</i>, “but where is the Caïd
Madani?”</p>

<p>“He is saying his prayers,” ventured the Sheik Marhoun.</p>

<p>The <i>bash agha</i> said, <i>“Alham dullah!”</i> (“May Allah be
praised”), but his eyes expressed, “Why the deuce must this idiot
say his prayers at lunchtime?”</p>

<p>I was seized with an uncontrollable desire to laugh, so I went
to the door and I saw, out on the plain, the tall figure of Madani,
his burnous spread out before him, bowing and prostrating himself
with that complete lack of self-consciousness so remarkable in all
Mohammedan devotions.</p>

<p>However, he finished and, after remaining for a moment in
meditation gazing out toward Mecca, he took up his burnous and
returned to us.</p>

<p>A low table and tray were brought and placed before the <i>bash
agha</i>. He motioned me to seat myself beside him, he called the
<i>kadi</i>, and he called an aged <i>agha</i> who seemed to have
suddenly grown out of the earth at the smell of food. The others
went and squatted at a respectful distance from the old man and
spoke in whispers.</p>

<p>A man passed round with a brass basin and jug and we all washed
our hands in silence.</p>

<p>A large bowl of <i>schorba</i>, highly spiced soup, was placed
on the table, some loaves of barley bread and some wooden spoons.
We all dipped into the bowl and commenced the meal. When the
<i>bash agha</i> had<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_277">[277]</span> finished we all put down our spoons, which
were carried away with the bowl and placed before the others.</p>

<p>The long Arab midday meal began: the <i>bourak</i>, or sausage
roll; the <i>mechoui</i>, which we clawed at with our fingers; the
<i>leham lalou</i>, stewed mutton with prunes; the
<i>kous-kous</i>; and finally the honey cakes.</p>

<p>As we finished each dish the remains were taken to the others,
who by this time had been joined by the <i>bash agha’s</i>
chauffeur.</p>

<p>A large jug of skimmed milk was passed round and we all took a
sip.</p>

<p><i>“Alham dullah,”</i> said the <i>bash agha</i>.</p>

<p><i>“Alham dullah,”</i> repeated the <i>kadi</i> with the aged
<i>agha</i> and the young <i>caïds</i>.</p>

<p>The man passed round with the brass tray and jug and the water,
and the <i>bash agha</i> went through a lengthy toilet which
commenced with his beard and ended with his fingers.</p>

<p>Coffee appeared.</p>

<p>We all sighed contentedly, the tension of before lunch had
disappeared. The <i>bash agha</i> lighted his pipe. I did the same,
while the others looked at us with envy, as they themselves could
not smoke in the old chief’s presence. Gradually they slipped
toward the door to get at their cigarettes.</p>

<p>“I wish to play cards,” suddenly said the <i>bash agha</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>caïds</i> paused at the door.</p>

<p>“Go on, Madani,” said the Caïd Aïssa.</p>

<p>“No, no, it’s not my turn,” he replied.</p>

<p>“And it isn’t mine,” said Marhoun.</p>

<p>“The <i>kadi</i> must play,” said the Caïd Ali.</p>

<p>“Yes, send along the <i>kadi</i>,” they all said.</p>

<p>“But I am always made to do this,” protested the man of peace,
“and I always lose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
</p>

<p>“It’s about all you’re fit for,” laughed Marhoun.</p>

<p>This was considered a great joke, and they hustled him back into
the presence of the <i>bash agha</i>, smiling at his woebegone
expression.</p>

<p>He squatted down opposite the old gentleman, the chauffeur
brought in some stones and placed them between the two players for
counters. That mysterious Hispano-Mauresque game began, a game
which came from the Peninsula when the Christian kings retook the
Alhambra and drove out the Arabs. The <i>kadi</i> looked more and
more like an early Victorian dandy than ever.</p>

<p>I sat and watched while the others poked fun at the victim,
discreetly, from the corner of the room.</p>

<p>But this time luck seemed to favor the judge and he began to
win; the <i>bash agha</i> got cross again; then he got sleepy; his
head began to nod, and finally he dropped off. The <i>kadi</i>
turned to me and winked knowingly while he gathered up his
winnings.</p>

<p>I dozed off too. Arab lunches are conducive to slumber, and I
understand why the Orientals recline at their repasts. . . .</p>

<p>Suddenly I was roused by Madani. “We ought to be getting away,”
he said, “but the <i>bash agha</i> is still asleep.”</p>

<p>“Well, wake him,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t. None of us can; we’d never hear the end of it,”
broke in Madani. “But you can.”</p>

<p>“But I certainly won’t,” I retorted. “I’m sleepy enough myself.
Make the <i>kadi</i> do it!”</p>

<p>This seemed to amuse Madani, and he returned to the other chiefs
and I saw that my suggestion was causing them joy. But not to the
<i>kadi</i>, who, as usual, protested, and I realized that he was
the sort of joke-man of the district. At last, however, he was
bustled into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
</p>

<p>He looked anxiously about and, finally, seeing the large brass
tray on which the <i>mechoui</i> had been served, he took it up and
dropped it with a crash on the part of the floor which was
uncarpeted. Then he fled out on to the plain.</p>

<p>The <i>bash agha</i> opened one eye, then the other, then seemed
about to sleep again. However, at that moment a diversion was
caused by the entry of the aged <i>agha</i> with the statement that
there was a man with a petition to make.</p>

<p>The <i>bash agha</i> came to and, sitting up, settled his turban
and became at once the “Emperor.”</p>

<p>The <i>caïds</i> became “princes,” and squatted down in a
semi-circle on the carpet; the chauffeur ventured back and started
mending a tire. The petitioner marched in and, after kissing the
old man’s shoulder, went and sat at a distance. For ten minutes he
said “How-do-you-do” in different poses and accents. For a moment
there was a lull, and then all of a sudden the storm burst, as in a
torrent of words he poured out his story.</p>

<p>He talked so rapidly that I only understood vaguely, but I
gathered that his flock had been stolen by nomads of the <i>bash
agha</i> who had come up from the south. The <i>bash agha</i> was
silent for a time, then he too burst into a flood of verbiage.</p>

<p>It was a most extraordinary group. The <i>bash agha</i> at one
end of the room, sitting on a heap of cushions, his whole attention
riveted on the man before him who squatted, speaking rapidly, but
with practically no gestures.</p>

<p>Occasionally one of the <i>caïds</i> would throw in a remark,
but otherwise one would have supposed that the matter was quite
indifferent to them. And yet it was a question which to these Arabs
was one of the greatest importance.</p>

<p>The complaint was of the tribe of the district who<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> accused one of the nomad
tribes of the Larba, now pasturing near-by, of stealing sheep. The
sheep had disappeared ten days ago and had been tracked with that
mysterious instinct across those limitless wastes of desert to
Ghardaia, three hundred miles to the south. The man wanted their
return as well as the punishment of the thieves.</p>

<p>The <i>bash agha</i> turned to the <i>kadi</i>, who for the
moment ceased being the joke-man, and spoke a few words to him.</p>

<p>The <i>kadi</i> nodded.</p>

<p>The <i>bash agha</i> addressed the Caïd Madani.</p>

<p>“This affects your tribe. You will send a mounted man to
Ghardaïa forthwith. He will apprehend the robbers and have them
drive the flocks back here. You will bring them before me at
Chellala.”</p>

<p><i>“Inch Allah,”</i> acquiesced Madani.</p>

<p>Justice was done. A horseman was to ride over the desert to
Ghardaïa and back, and I pictured a Lord-Lieutenant of Sussex
saying to the sheriff: “You will tell a constable to bicycle to
Edinburgh and fetch back a couple of hundred sheep,” just as one
might say, “Go and post this letter.” It was a marvelous example of
the simplicity of primitive justice.</p>

<p>The <i>bash agha</i> rose. The complainant kissed his turban,
and we all followed the old man out.</p>

<p>During lunch the sky had become gray and the wind was coming
from the north in cold gusts, bringing clouds of sand and grit.</p>

<p>We all piled into the car again and started on our return
journey.</p>

<p>The sky grew darker and in a few minutes the rain began. Rain in
Algeria is quite common on the coast in winter or spring, but rain
in the neighborhood of the desert rarely comes after March, and
when it does it is good for the cultivator but it is not amusing
for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span> those who
travel. The first dried river-bed we came to was far from dry, the
second was running with water, the dry track before the third had
become a morass, the third was gurgling gaily down, and the road
was an inch or so under water.</p>

<p>At this point we punctured. We all got out and looked at the
flat tire, but no one did anything.</p>

<p>I said, “Suppose we change the wheel.”</p>

<p>The chauffeur said, “The spare wheel is punctured too. We must
change the inner tube, but I don’t think it will last long.”</p>

<p>We got out the inner tube; it looked rather wretched, and a
preliminary pump-up revealed that it held little air. Another one
was found which appeared to be air-tight. The rain swept icily
across the great plain. The kadi shivered and drew his burnous
about him. Marhoun took off the wheel; the <i>bash agha</i> smoked
his pipe as he sat on the running-board. The <i>caïds</i> talked
and laughed at the miserable <i>kadi</i>. There was none of that
fever and excitement and cursing of the chauffeur which one would
have seen among Europeans on such an occasion. The chauffeur had
forgotten to mend the spare wheel; it was the will of God and
nothing could be done to remedy it.</p>

<p>At last we started again, but the next <i>oued</i> was a rushing
torrent. The car floundered in water swirled about the axles, the
engine roared, the chauffeur shouted something and every one,
except the <i>bash agha</i>, tumbled out into the water. I followed
and started pushing, while the water raced round us about up to our
knees. The car began to move, and at last laboriously climbed out
of the river.</p>

<p>“Only just in time,” exclaimed Aïssa. “Look.”</p>

<p>I did so, and I saw, to my amazement, a kind of swirling mass of
water sweeping down the river, and before I could count two the
<i>oued</i> had become a raging,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_282">[282]</span> overflowing torrent. A few minutes sooner
and car and all would have been swept away.</p>

<p>“Luckily that is the last <i>oued</i>,” said Ali.</p>

<p>We all got in and started off again. The chauffeur put on speed,
and we bumped furiously over the holes in the road. Then the other
tire went. We stopped and all got out and then all got in
again.</p>

<p><i>“Ma kanch chambre à air,”</i> said the chauffeur. (“No more
inner tubes.”)</p>

<p>In a few minutes the original tire went again, and we all got
out again and all got back. We crawled along on the rims. Suddenly
I became aware that my feet were getting very cold and wet. I could
not understand. I asked Madani, but he had reached a state when he
no longer seemed to care. He was telling his beads.</p>

<p>I moved my legs about and suddenly, to my astonishment,
discovered that my feet were hanging in space. I peered down and
perceived water and mud splashing all round me, and realized that
the bottom of the car had fallen out. Visions of the pantomime
gentleman whose carriage loses its floor and who is obliged to run
between the wheels, sprang before me. And I saw myself and Madani
being precipitated on to the road and having to run wildly back to
Chellala, unable to make the chauffeur hear our cries of
distress.</p>

<p>However, this catastrophe did not take place, for the simple
reason that the car suddenly stopped of its own accord. We all got
out again. No one seemed to dare to ask what the matter was.</p>

<p><i>“Ma kanch petrol,”</i> said the chauffeur calmly.</p>

<p>“No more petrol!” exclaimed the <i>bash agha</i> nervously. It
was the first time during the whole of the proceedings that he had
shown any emotion.</p>

<p><i>“Ma kanch,”</i> repeated the driver.</p>

<p>No one spoke. I heard Madani murmuring<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_283">[283]</span> <i>“Mektoub,”</i> but otherwise there was
silence as we stood there in the driving rain watching the car.
Then suddenly the <i>bash agha</i> said, as if to the skies, “I
pray Allah that it is raining like this in the Tell; my brother’s
crops have sore need of rain.”</p>

<p><i>“Inch Allah,”</i> they all said.</p>

<p>It filled me with amazement. I had before me the complete
abstraction of immediate discomfort, the unaccountable Oriental
mind, praying to Allah, miles from anywhere, soaked to the skin,
and with no means of getting home. I thought of my English friends
and their attitude and thoughts on such an occasion. However, it
was no good standing in contemplation.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you propose doing?” I ventured at last. “I am
getting cold.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the old man, brushing drops of rain off
his beard. “What do you think, my friend?”</p>

<p>“To my mind the only possible thing to do is to walk back before
it gets too dark,” I said.</p>

<p>“But the rain,” said the <i>kadi</i>, “and the mud, and the
wind!”</p>

<p>“A little rain and wind more or less never did me any harm,” I
replied; “though perhaps I am more used to it than you.”</p>

<p>“Of course, he is right,” said Madani. “We will leave the
chauffeur with the car and we’ll be in Chellala before six.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said the Caïd Ali. “I know a short cut across the
hills which will reduce our journey by at least a third.”</p>

<p>The <i>kadi</i> started murmuring again, but seeing that the
<i>bash agha</i> agreed to this proposal, he felt that he could not
let an old man of seventy do what he feared to do, so he
reluctantly followed us. In single file we started across the waste
of water and tufts of alfa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
</p>

<p>Madani led, then came Ali, after him Aïssa, then the <i>bash
agha</i>, then myself, and behind me the <i>kadi</i>, with Marhoun
bringing up the rear. The wind blew fiercely across our path,
bringing great sheets of soaking rain, but our camel’s hair
burnouses kept the wet out wonderfully. Only the <i>kadi</i>, who
had a kind of black woven burnous, complained that he was getting
soaked. I distinctly heard Marhoun laughing in the driving
rain.</p>

<p>Gradually we approached the hills, all wrapped in mist, and
descending into a habitually dry river-bed, splashed up the muddy
bank.</p>

<p>Suddenly the <i>kadi</i> gave a yell.</p>

<p>“I’ve lost my shoes,” he screamed.</p>

<p>“Where?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“In the mud! They got stuck and came off!”</p>

<p>The procession stopped. Aïssa started laughing. I became
perfectly helpless as I watched the wretched judge making futile
dives for his slippers in the muddy torrent.</p>

<p>At last Marhoun got the better of his mirth and managed to
secure the lost property, but, as can be imagined, the elegant
slippers looked like bits of old leather ready for the dust-heap.
The <i>kadi</i> began wailing again, and said he would go back, but
Marhoun pushed him up the bank and he plodded on.</p>

<p>We soon came to a goat-track and gradually began climbing the
steep slopes of the hill. As we rose, the mist closed down upon us
and wrapped us in its damp embrace. I could no longer see Madani,
and the <i>bash agha</i> was only a dim form before me. The
<i>kadi</i> I didn’t need to see as his wail of malediction on
motor-cars and excursions, and idiots who could live out in the
desert, never ceased.</p>

<p>After an hour or so we reached the summit and gathered together
in a ghostly group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
</p>

<p>“Not very far now,” said Ali gaily. “Reminds me of winter in the
trenches. Eh, Aïssa?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Vosges,” he replied. “Not too tired, <i>bash
agha</i>?”</p>

<p>The old man shook his head and he brushed the drops from his
burnous.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s proceed,” said Madani. “We don’t want to be caught
by the night.”</p>

<p>“My shoes are full of stones,” moaned the <i>kadi</i>. “Well,
take them out,” exclaimed Marhoun.</p>

<p>Without further ado we started along the crest and soon began
descending another path. The wind was less fierce on this side of
the mountain, but the mist swirled like a great shroud about us.
None of us spoke as we plodded on in our dripping burnouses. My
mind became a sort of damp blank as I mechanically followed in the
procession.</p>

<p>Suddenly the <i>bash agha</i> said to me over his shoulder,
“What has become of Miss G., who was in Laghouat for two months
this spring?”</p>

<p>“Eh?” I said.</p>

<p>He repeated his question.</p>

<p>“Oh, she has gone back to Scotland,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Why did she go?” again asked the old man.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose she wanted to see her family and get back to this
sort of weather,” I answered vaguely.</p>

<p>“She was a very nice girl,” said the <i>bash agha</i>. “She was
full of gaiety. I liked her.”</p>

<p>He lapsed into silence again. I followed on, wondering how the
brain of Jelloul ben Lahkdar, <i>bash agha</i> of all the Larbas,
reasoned, that he should suddenly ask me the whereabouts of an
English friend of mine while descending the slopes of the mountains
of Chellala in a Scotch mist. The working of an Oriental mind has
always been and always will be a mystery to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
</p>

<p>However, the mist was beginning to clear and the rain was
abating when suddenly, from nowhere, the sun, brilliant in its
setting, burst through the clouds, and we looked out on to the
smiling village of Chellala nestling among its green trees, and out
on to the great plains of the Sersou, right away to the blue
mountains of the Atlas in the distance. That wonderful Algerian
climate, where there is never a day without a little sun to keep
one’s spirits alive to the glories of nature!</p>

<p>Every one seemed to cheer up.</p>

<p>I turned round and looked at the <i>kadi</i> and I mercifully
restrained my laughter, as the picture of wretchedness he presented
was too genuine to admit of more jests.</p>

<p>“You’ll be in dry clothes soon, <i>kadi</i>,” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I shall take great care never to leave my home again, <i>Inch
Allah</i>,” he groaned.</p>

<p>At the moment Marhoun started singing one of those strange,
melodious songs of the great South with the deep, long note drawn
out at the end. Aïssa picked it up and sent back the verse,
trembling, high and melancholy. Marhoun returned with the refrain,
so soft, so gentle, that I approached the <i>bash agha</i> and
asked him the meaning of the words.</p>

<p>He smiled and said, “I can not give it exactly translated
because it is too beautiful in Arabic, but it runs thus: ‘My love
is as great as the fire, and it consumes my heart.’”</p>

<p>And I repeated it to myself, wondering on the strange nature of
the Arabs, as the sun, all orange and gold, dipped behind the
hills, wrapping the land in golden radiance.</p>

<h3>5. <em>The Turkish Bath in Algeria</em></h3>

<p>We have heard a great deal in this book about religion; let us
turn our attention for a brief moment to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_287">[287]</span> its great adjunct, especially in the Moslem
faith— cleanliness.</p>

<p>To the average Englishman the words “Turkish bath” suggest tiled
chambers, whiteness, great heat, much water and complete
exhaustion. This is what he has seen in Jermyn Street. In his
imagination he may have conjured up a vision of the <i>hammam</i>
of the East with its marble halls and multi-colored tiles, its
splashing fountains and exhilarating hashish, while ebony-bodied
negroes flit noiselessly about. Now, though this average Englishman
will never be bathed in this <i>Arabian Nights</i> atmosphere in
Algeria, let it be known that his imagination has not altogether
run into the realms of fable.</p>

<p>In certain private houses of great chiefs this atmosphere, to a
lesser degree, exists, and the owner of the bath insists on all the
most luxurious rites being carried out. However, as this remains
private property it can not be entered into, and it will suffice to
describe the common Turkish bath known in Algeria as <i>le bain
maure</i>, which resident or tourist, pedler or <i>caïd</i>,
respectable maiden or <i>femme du Quartier</i>, must use if
cleanliness is to be observed.</p>

<p>In this haunt of steam and strange odors there will be found
neither the tiled chambers of Jermyn Street nor the splashing
fountains of Haroun al-Raschid. The entrance to the bath is usually
imposing; this is presumably to attract the passer-by. The
entrance-hall is also roomy, and with a purpose, as it is here that
many of the Faithful come to say their prayers after their
ablutions. After this there is a series of primary disillusions. I
purposely use the word “primary.”</p>

<p>To undress, one is ushered into a small chamber, where probably
a number of other persons of all ranks and ages are already
undressing. One hastily confides<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_288">[288]</span> one’s purse to the owner or manager of the
bath, who puts it in his pocket. This looks risky at first sight,
but it is in reality quite safe. Having disrobed, an emaciated
bandit appears and, placing a towel about one’s body and one about
one’s head, proffers a pair of wooden clogs, which are flat pieces
of wood the shape of the sole of a shoe with a strap to go across
the foot. They appear to be harmless affairs at first sight; I
emphasize “sight,” for the moment one suggests that they should be
modes of locomotion one is disillusioned. For some unknown reason
these clogs have a distaste to progress in a forward direction and
seem bent on going either to the right or to the left, or in both
directions at the same time—anyway, at right angles to the proposed
progress of the wearer, which rationally should be toward the
bath.</p>

<p>At first it needs the strength and will power of a great and
persevering man to advance with the aid of the wall out of the
lofty court to the heated chamber. The passage is usually narrow
and full of stagnant water, the light is conspicuous by its
absence, and as one gropes for the entrance one’s mind rushes back
to memories of the dungeons beneath the Ducal Palace in Venice.
When at last the massive door has been pulled back, one’s terror,
if anything, increases. A cloud of damp, suffocating steam fills
the chamber, the body becomes suddenly moist, and one instinctively
turns to the exit. However, it is too late; the emaciated bandit is
behind, and pushes one forward through pools of water to a large
square slab.</p>

<p>The eyes are gradually getting used to the dim light thrown by a
single sputtering candle, and one distinguishes little by little
the forms of other people washing in various corners of the room.
The heat is intense, the steam swirls about the ceiling, the grunts
and murmurs of the bathers make one think of Doré’s<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span> illustrations of Dante’s
<i>Inferno</i>. However, little time is allowed for reflection in
this place of torment, as suddenly the skeleton which has done the
undressing and the guiding pushes one on to the floor, where, lying
on a kind of blue duster, one awaits the rack!</p>

<p>And here the beauty, the glorious compensation for all the rest,
begins. Of all the masseurs in the world, be they British, Latin,
or Scandinavian, there are none I have met who can equal the Arab
of the Algerian south. No training, no knowledge of anatomy—these
men, by some curious instinct, understand the wants of the body,
and as one lies in this steaming atmosphere one feels all the pains
and poisons of the human frame being magically pressed out of one.
It is a complete relaxation, a complete cure to all ills, and when
the coarse glove is put on and the rolls of fat come out of the
opened pores of the skin, it is done as gently as a mother
powdering her baby. Soap follows, warm water after that, until the
cold douche, poured out of a wooden bucket, brings one to one’s
feet and, transformed and light-hearted, one returns fearless along
the dark passage to be massaged with towels till dry.</p>

<p>The result is magical; magical the swiftness with which it is
all accomplished, magical when one realizes that the total fee for
the bath is five francs.</p>

<p>The white-tiled chamber and the exhilarating hashish may add to
the delight of the thing, but to feel a sensation of real fitness
give me the common Arab masseur in the common Arab bath in the far
south.</p>

<p>I am told that the negresses who look after the women who attend
the bath on specific days of the week have also great merits. Of
this I am ignorant, but of all things I miss most, when away in
Europe, my emaciated bandit who “masses” out of my body all
weariness—mental and physical—disease and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_290">[290]</span> cares, who sends me out into the street
capable of sitting down to write a chapter of <i>Algeria from
Within</i>.</p>

<h3>6. <em>The Keef Smoker</em></h3>

<p>Before closing these sketches of Arab life a word must be said
on a vice which is luckily not very prevalent, but which
nevertheless exists in many centers.</p>

<p>I speak of keef-smoking.</p>

<p>Keef is the dried flower of the hemp-plant chopped up and smoked
like tobacco, rolled in a cigarette, or in the bowl of a small
pipe. In a different form it is the basis of the hashish sweets,
rarely seen in Algeria, but very common in the Near East.</p>

<p>The effect of keef on the smoker is to make him practically
independent of food and sleep as long as he is under its influence,
and a habitual keef-taker is easy to detect. His eyes are very
bright, his face is pale and drawn, his arms and hands are terribly
thin, his movements are restless. At the same time he is not at all
dazed like one under the influence of a drug, and though after a
few days’ smoking he will drift off into a kind of feverish sleep,
during the early periods he is extraordinarily lucid. In fact, it
is said that the first effects of keef are to make the brain work
at three times its normal pace.</p>

<p>European tourists in the south occasionally get hold of some
keef to smoke, and complain that it has had no effect at all beyond
giving them a sore throat. This is quite normal, as the fact of
smoking a little hemp in a pipe or cigarette will hurt no one if
not continued. To feel the effect of keef one must smoke for at
least one night through, and three days are necessary to get really
poisoned. The danger of an experiment of this kind is that the
desire to go on may seize one, and once keef has taken hold of a
man it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span> rare to
see it give him up. However, it is quite amusing to go to a
keef-smoking den, all the more so as it has to be done in secret
and with the connivance of a smoker, as no outsiders know where
these little nocturnal <i>réunions</i> take place.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact I doubt whether there is much danger of the
police interfering as, though it is against the law to smoke keef,
the French are not going to try to stop something which must always
go on, and unless the offense is deliberately open they will not
peer into the dark streets to catch a few poor Arabs.</p>

<p>The town where keef-smoking is the most prevalent, I believe, is
Ghardaïa—not of course among the puritan Mzabites, but in the Arab
quarter. This is partly due to the fact that these Arabs are far
away from their own people, and club together in small groups to do
what they would not dare do before their relatives in their own
oases.</p>

<p>I remember going to one of these places in the Mzab with some
English friends who wanted to see the den for themselves. We were a
curious party—an English girl, a short-story writer and another man
connected with letters—none of whom knew the country well, while
our Arab guide was the <i>khodja</i> of the Bureau Arabe, a man
unbelievably fat, who rather sailed along the street than walked.
We passed through interminable little streets, pitch black, fell up
and down steps until we came to a tumble-down house, all dark save
for a yellow light which flickered in an upper chamber. The tinkle
of a mandolin floated out, a warm breeze sent little whirls of dust
up the narrow way, the stars stood out bright in the sky.</p>

<p>Our immense companion tapped mysteriously at the door, the sound
of the mandolin ceased, and we heard some one coming cautiously
down-stairs. A few whispered words were exchanged, followed by
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span> noise of heavy
bolts being drawn, the door swung back, and we found ourselves in
front of a rickety wooden staircase at the foot of which stood an
Arab in tattered clothes, who held aloft a hissing acetylene lamp.
He scrutinized us closely, and then, bidding us enter, drew aside
as we filed slowly past and followed our fat friend up the stairs.
The janitor waited till we were all inside, and then with a clash
shot back the bolts, and we felt ourselves prisoners in this
illicit haunt.</p>

<p>At the top of the stairs we came to a room dimly lighted, and
the first thing which struck our attention was an enormous skin
full of water. When I say that it struck our attention it is not
quite exact, as in reality it was struck by the head of my friend
S. A., who had not noticed it until a stream of icy water poured
down his back. When we had recovered from this pleasing little
incident we looked about us.</p>

<p>On the floor all round the little room squatted men of all ages
and grades—some in rags, some in prosperous-looking
<i>gandourahs</i>, some in very modern red fezzes—but all with the
same hungry look on their drawn faces. At the far end the Arab who
had opened the door attended to the little fireplace ornamented
with colored tiles and on which he prepared coffee and mint tea; in
the middle of the group sat the mandolinist playing with a far-away
look in his shining eyes.</p>

<p>The air was heavy with a sweet, rather sickly smell, an odor not
unlike new-mown hay, only stronger. A bench was mysteriously
produced for us and for our stout companion, who explained that if
he sat on the ground he would never be able to get up again. Tea
was placed before us, and then rather diffidently one of the
corpses on the floor rose and offered Miss G. a small pipe. Seeing
she was prepared to smoke, he drew a wallet from the folds of his
<i>gandourah</i> and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_293">[293]</span> filled the bowl with the strange
grayish-green, tobacco-looking matter, and handed it back to
her.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile we had also been supplied with similar pipes,
and in a few moments we had lighted up. The taste was not pleasant
to the regular pipe-smoker like myself, and at the same time it was
not as nasty as my first attempts at smoking when in the depths of
a wood my brother and I, aged nine and ten, filled a cast-off pipe
of my father’s with brown paper in the belief that we were
smoking!</p>

<p>Keef is better than brown paper. The taste and smell were rather
like that of hay.</p>

<p>When the company saw that we were quite human and ready to join
in the fun there was a general relaxation. All the pipes were
lighted, the mandolinist tuned up, and soon the whole crowd was as
merry as children at a birthday party. In fact, so great was the
effect of the atmosphere that S. A. insisted on singing himself,
and would have danced had not M. J., who has his interests at
heart, held him forcibly on the bench.</p>

<p>I don’t know how long this would have gone on had not a discreet
signal from the street warned us that the police were making their
rounds. In a second the light was dimmed, the music ceased, and we
sat as still as mice until we heard the measured tramp of the Arab
constables disappearing up the street. We felt it more discreet to
depart ourselves, so we took leave of our fevered-eyed hosts and
returned to our inn.</p>

<p>Though I spent a rather restless night, I don’t know if it was
the effect of the reef or not, and we all certainly felt quite fit
the next day.</p>

<p>Still, I can never think of that night without smiling; it was
all so mysterious, so much part of another world, and I often
wonder if M. J., as he sits editorially in London, or S. A.,
scooping in royalties, or Miss G.,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_294">[294]</span> in her English surroundings, realize how
they peeped into the past for a few seconds and lived again the
life which, if it had not been Algerian, would have probably been
celebrated by another De Quincey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
</p>

<h2><a id="c39"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX<br>
<span class="sc2">A LAST GLANCE AT THE ARAB</span></h2>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> preface of a book should always be
written at the end; this insures it being read. In this particular
work the first chapter rather takes the place of the preface, but
at the same time there are certain things which rather need
explaining.</p>

<p>In the first place, the necessity to compress the matter into a
limited number of pages. On practically every subject mentioned,
there is material in my mind to write a book, and it is difficult
to realize where to stop. It is equally difficult to know where to
begin as, to some, the information set out in these pages will not
be new, and they may be looking for something deeper. Of these
people I ask patience, for if the result of the book is
encouraging, another one will follow, and perhaps another, dealing
at length with the subjects only touched on now.</p>

<p>This work has been prepared more as something which any traveler
can read during his journey to Algiers, and which will allow him to
see the country through other eyes than those of the guides, be
they books, chauffeurs, or the luxuriously uniformed gentlemen of
the Transatlantic Company.</p>

<p>Let it, moreover, be understood that the history, the geography,
the remarks on French administration are, more than anything else,
a prelude to the rest of the book, “The Arabs.”</p>

<p>The Arabs, whether they be those in the scarlet<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span> burnouses of the
<i>caïd</i>-ship or in the rags of the beggar, are all the same: a
people who have destroyed without creating, who have been divided
when their unity would have made them great, who have lived on
theory.</p>

<p>We have before us the relics of the Carthaginians, of the
Numidians, of the stupendous work of the Roman Empire, and then
centuries of nothing. War, devastation, intrigue, mark the period
covered by the Arab domination.</p>

<p>Even those buildings which we see in Algiers, at Constantine and
in the other ancient towns, are the work of Turkish or European
architects. And yet, in spite of this apparent futility of
existence, in spite of this atmosphere of strife, there is
something very noble in the nature of the Arabs, something very
engaging, something utterly aloof from all that is European; for in
spite of dissension among themselves they are all held under the
sway of Islam, that all-powerful principle which separates them
entirely from all other persuasions.</p>

<p>Moreover, the longer one lives among the Arabs the more one
realizes the insurmountable barrier which separates us from them.
It is not a question of race, though this does count; it is a
question of religion. One can establish the deepest intimacy in all
matters of daily life and then suddenly come face to face with this
blank wall.</p>

<p>Some Europeans contend that it is possible really to become as
the Arabs—even to mate with them. The few who have tried this last
experiment have met with utter disaster. I know a <i>caïd</i> who
has been all over Europe, who occasionally wears European clothes,
who has had affairs with women of all nationalities, but without
ever legally marrying one. He told me that twice he had been on the
point of doing so, but that reason had always prevailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
</p>

<p>“How could it be?” he exclaimed. “How could the gulf which
separates us from you ever be spanned? How could a European woman
admit being shut up, or, if she emancipated herself, being
considered by us on the same level as a woman of the Quarter? How
could she admit to her children being brought up in the principles
of the Koran, with our habits and customs? Why, we don’t even sleep
in beds or sit on chairs; we eat with our hands; we have no
learning; we never read books. We don’t consider any belief but our
own; and, even if such a mating began successfully, how could you
expect one of your people to admit the husband taking other wives
to live legally under the same roof if he felt so inclined?”</p>

<p>This is so obvious that it seems almost superfluous to speak of
it, and yet there are Europeans who will not see the impossibility
of such a step; there are some who have actually taken it; I know a
few of them. I have never mentioned the subject to them; the look
in their eyes has told me more than any words, and has made me
shrink from further laying bare the wound.</p>

<p>I was talking to an educated Arab not so long ago about
religions, and he expressed the opinion that only Mohammedans would
go to heaven. I suggested that the question of after-life was not
so much judged by religion as by the actions of men, and I quoted
the example of a very worthy Christian we know, respected by all
Arabs, and a hopeless, immoral, drinking <i>marabout</i>.</p>

<p>“Which of the two will be recompensed, the honest and sober
unbeliever, or that scoundrel who calls himself a holy man of
yours?”</p>

<p>“I can not say,” he replied, after a moment’s thought; “but
probably neither of them will go to paradise.”</p>

<p>“What?” I exclaimed. “You mean to suggest that<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span> worthy Mr. X., who has spent
the whole of his life doing good, will find himself in company with
your drunken <i>marabout</i>?”</p>

<p>“I can not say,” repeated the Arab; “but if our friend believes
that Jesus is the Son of God, he can not go to heaven. God is above
all, and no one is like him.”</p>

<p>“That is all very well,” I said; “but our religion says that if
you don’t believe in the divinity of Jesus you will also not go to
paradise; that is why I am contending that people can not be judged
by their respective faiths, but by their actions.”</p>

<p>“But your religion is wrong,” he said finally.</p>

<p>I was on the point of continuing the argument, but the look in
his eyes made me desist. This belief, to him, was conclusive
evidence.</p>

<p>And that is Islam, that is the Arab; his faith is absolute, and
his opinion of other religions is quite simple—they don’t
exist.</p>

<p>“Why,” they say, “we believe in Moses and Aaron and Jacob and
Elijah and Jesus; they are all great prophets who preceded ours;
what more do you want?”</p>

<p>A wall—a blank wall which no one can pierce without becoming a
Mohammedan. <i>Et encore</i>. . . .</p>

<p>The more one lives with these people the more apparent this
becomes, and if in this book the impressions given differ from
those which have struck others, perhaps it is because only one side
of the character has been seen, the character <i>allowed to be
seen</i> by the Roumi.</p>

<p>I know the Arabs well, I know them intimately, but I have not
the remotest idea what they think of me, and I never shall
have.</p>

<p>There may be future developments of this book, with possible
reversal of certain opinions, but as far<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_299">[299]</span> as the working of the Arab brain is
concerned, I know that I have penetrated as far as I ever shall.
Let the reader, therefore, close this volume realizing the task
which has been before the author—who, after spending over five
years constantly studying these people, has arrived at this
somewhat negative conclusion.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
